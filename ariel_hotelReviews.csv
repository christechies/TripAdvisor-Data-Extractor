",50,"The place is around the city district. Curated breakfast was fun and exciting to pick. Easy check in and out! Staff are amazing.  Catherine reservation manager, was so prompt to answer our emails. Micher was always very helpful from front office and Marlon was very friendly. Salamat! Till our next stay."
1,June 2021,Graduation weekend in a Pet friendly Hotel!,NA,50,"My daughter had her Virtual High School graduation (COVID!!!) last June 2021 and we wanted a place with a really huge smart TV, that was pet friendly as well. We have a lovable corgi and my daughter couldn't leave him behind for this occasion. Joy Joy Nostalg Hotel and Suites was perfect with large spacious suites and pet friendly!!"
2,July 2021,Our first stay," Traveled as a couple
",50,Room was in excellent condition  Staff are very polite and friendly  Food tastes great. Water supply is very good considering we stayed at the 27th floor All equipment are in tip-top shape. Love the pool area and the sauna  I wish there is a deodorant in the bathroom as a part of the hygiene kit. And a small clock will do.  We will definitely be back. It’s now our default hotel to stay.
3,July 2021,A great place to stay,NA,50,"It’s a great place to stay. Staffs were friendly, caring, and pleasant, starting from the reception. Meals are very good and delicious. Rooms are very clean and relaxing. I highly recommend the hotel for locals and foreigners. I would probably choose Joy Nostalg Hotel & Suites Manila next time as I have experience warm welcomes of the staff, excellent service and pleasantness of hotel crew."
4,June 2021,Business Meeting (accommodation and function room)," Traveled on business
",50,"Kudos for room accommodation. We were able to maximize the washing machine with dryer, sauna, television inside the comfort room, kitchen with ref and induction. The food is so good! I highly recommend their indian food option.   With regards to the function hall during our business meeting, they provided us complete materials such as pen and notepads, projector, microphones, etc. Two thumbs up for Sir Joven and Sir Nikko in attending all our needs.   I am now excited for our next business meetings that will be done again in this hotel. :)"
5,February 2021,Exceeded our expectations!,NA,50,"Our stay exceeded our expectations! From the smooth booking, to the warm greeting upon check-in. We had our pup with us and while we got our rapid testing done, they looked after our dog, which I thought was very sweet! The room was very clean, smelled really good and had a bed prepared for our dog. We used their facilities and we informed them ahead of time so they could schedule us in for our safety and to avoid any risk due to the current climate. Our breakfasts were brought up to us and had a great variety, the croissants were so good!  We had a very relaxing, enjoyable and memorable staycation. Prior to this stay, we didnt think was possible since we worried that safety might be overlooked but it was certainly prioritized at Joy Nostalg, without compromising the comfort and"
6,March 2021,Joy Nostalg: Finding Joy indoors,NA,50,"Sometimes, a quick escape from the noise of our everyday work/class is not enough to relax and recharge. A little bit of sophistication is essential. That is what Joy Nostalg offers. A feeling of convenience, partnered with elegance. The rooms are spotless and provides a vibe that you are in the comfort of your home. The bathrooms are well-maintained and organize. The beds and pillows will surely invite you at first glance. The staff are accommodating and courteous. It's always a pleasant experience here in Joy Nostalg even during the pandemic."
7,February 2021,"MORE THAN HOME, AWAY FROM HOME.",NA,40,"Even though my request for two single beds were not available, me and my son enjoyed our stay at Joy Nostalg. We shared a King size bed which was very comfy. We checked in a little late so we requested for a late check out which they granted. So we were able to use their swimming pool, jacuzzi and their state of the art gym equipments ( mostly LIfe Fitness brand). Very friendly staff. But WIFI signal was not too strong. The food at Nostalgia Lounge was also very good. We felt safe fr. the virus because all clients checking in are required to have an Antigen rapid test (Nasal only) On site. We paid for 1,500 each for the test. We really enjoyed our stay."
8,December 2020,Stay at Joy Nostalgia,NA,50,Our accomodation was 3 days and 2 nights. We enjoyed our stay at Joy with all the friendly staff and good ambiance. Our room had a great view outside. We had no trouble checking in and out. Me and my wife will definitely book again here. :)
9,December 2020,Worth it staycation with my furbaby!,NA,50,"I usually go on staycations on my own, but this time it was a memorable one because I was able to bring my furbaby along with me.  The room where I stayed was nice, the bed and the pillows was awesome.  Everyone from the guards, the reception, housekeeping, room service folks were a delight to interact with.  Very professional, great demeanor and had smiles on their faces.  Most of all, my furbaby - Cotton loved it!  He enjoyed our stay so much!  The only downside I have is my room doesn't have a bath tub.  Hopefully next time, I get one."
10,November 2020,Rude and discriminating!,NA,10,Went here today for a seminar to the property they unfortunately also own. I went here with my father who drove me to this place. He (pay) parked his car at the basement and planned to wait for me at the hotel's restaurant as a customer who can afford and will definitely be paying. We were highly discriminated for being a client of their low-cost project. Staff were assertive about our presence inside the hotel and kept asking where are we from and why are we there. They wouldn't even let us use the elevator despite of being a customer at the restaurant. We're supposed to have dinner there but was too pissed that we just left. My father was impressed by the hotel's interiors and suggested that our family should try the place out which I immediately dismissed. I suggest if they
11,September 2020,Balanced review,NA,30,"Great location if you have to be in or near Ortigas Center. Conveniently located next to convenience stores and small restaurants. Good for a short stay. Due to the Coronavirus lockdown, we got stuck at the facility for nearly seven months.  The best department was the Housekeeping department. Thank you for keeping our rooms sparkling clean. One of the best housekeeping departments I have ever seen. The next department worth a mention was the Food & Beverage department who were at times extremely challenged to provide both a room delivery and a dine-in service. Food quality and quantity was not the best at times nor the mannerisms of the staff to elicit tips but they managed to pull it off. Now for the bad: The hotel is old and like most old hotels has a thin veneer of make-up"
12,March 2020,Review,NA,50,"Nice place with good food, good staff specially Nina she is very accommodating ang friendly and the very jolly bartender Hope I'll surely come back because of them. Keep up the good work guys!! Godbless 😊"
13,February 2020,Big room,NA,40,"Mine was a one bedroom, room is spacious and facilities is good. They don’t have bottled water, tap has a switch that will give filtered drinking water, which is good, environmental friendly. Gym has standard equipment, just that it closes too early at 9pm. If you want to use it, you can still use it, just sign indemnity form. Breakfast selection is not a lot like other 4-5 star hotels. Food is salty but it’s expected in Philippines. Coffee is mediocre, I asked for cappuccino and they wants to charge which is not good. "
14,March 2020,No parking slot for hotel guest,NA,10,"I cannot believe this hotel does not have parking slot for hotel guests (apparently, it’s on a first come- first serve basis... WTF?!?). They don’t even have  valet services and they’re asking me to use the public parking outside the hotel!!!!"
15,February 2020,Comfortable and convenient ,NA,50,"Great room-comfortable bed, good shower, handy kitchenette. Service was impeccable, from housekeeping to laundry to bar/restaurant. Especially liked the washer/dryer combo in the room, which was convenient for items you don’t wish to send out. Kettle was used for tea dai!"
16,January 2020,Complete Room Amenities,NA,50,"I loved that the room had its own kitchen with the complete equipment and utensils, including its manuals neatly filed in a clear book.  The ref was a big one, not those bar refs.  It had a comfy sofa which can also be used for sleeping by a third guest.  The cabinets were spacious.  More importantly, it had a fully automatic washing machine.  Elevator was fast, not too many guests, I think, since it was a wednesday-thursday stay.  Only concern was the ongoing construction nearby which created noise during the wee hours of the morning."
17,December 2019,WE LOVE THE BREAKFAST,NA,50,"We had our Christmas celebration with friends here. Each of pair booked Premier Rooms ---- highly recommended. Walking distance to a good mall (The Podium), mini stop and 711  We love the breakfast. Its not overwhelming, and its unlimited YAKULT! We did not use the pool, but its okay. We are really checked in for a Christmas Get Together Staycation, and location is perfect for everyone.   Thanks to the staff! :)"
18,January 2020,Work trip,NA,30,"The joy-nostalg is a generally nice hotel, all the staff are friendly and accommodating. Rooms are large and similar to a one bedroom apartment. The 6th floor is where breakfast is as well as the space for lunch, dinner and the bar. It is an open space and on one end is a smoking lounge. Because of the door opening and closing constantly, the whole room smells of smoke and gives you a headache. The smoke smell can be very sensitive to particular people. It would be great if this could be managed better to contain the smoke so the people in the food area do not have to experience it or move the location to outside the hotel. Overall, nice hotel and nice staff but the smoke smell on the 6th floor is tough, especially for someone that is on that floor constantly for meetings."
19,January 2020,My stay was exellent except for some facilities that needs improvement,NA,40,"My stay was exellent except for some facilities that needs improvement:  We stayed at Room 2304  1. Sink giving off bad odor - When we got there, the sink was giving off foul smell. We have reported it to the staff. What they did the first time they went to our room to fix the problem was just to spray on the whole room to eliminate the bad odor but it didn't go away. so We called the staff the second time and they declogged the sink i guess but the odor did not went away. Bad experience.  2. TV wifi didn't work - the staff sent 2 technicians but wasn't able to fix the problem hence we did not enjoy wifi connection for the TV "
20,January 2020,Excellent!,NA,50,"As always, our stay was marvelous and everything was perfect! The staff catered to all our needs and the amenities were well-maintained. Breakfast was also excellent and the choices were extensive. We will be sure to return!"
21,January 2020,Wonderful stay,NA,50,"My first time to visit this hotel. The hotel room is spaceous and very clean. The people are very welcoming. I remember the smile of Micher from the reception. She was so nice. I'd like to thank Mark too. He was very helpful with my husband with the bags we have left after a dinner outside. Special mebtion to Russel, the housekeeping attendant. He helped us with the gas stove. Thank you Joy Nostalg. I will certainly go back to this hotel no only because of the hotel but mainly because you can feel a home away from home because of the people in this hotel."
22,December 2019,"Almost ideal, except...",NA,40,"Booked a room for 2 adults and 1 child on New Year's eve. I thought we could check-in online bcoz the email from Joy Nostalg says ""Check-in online by 11am on Tuesday."" And so I waited till it was 11am so I can check-in online. Unfortunately, the email I got from them was misleading... the online check-in ends at 11am pala! And so, we were forced to drop by at the hotel first thing so we can check-in, before going to Megamall to buy something. Pero good thing na rin that we arrived early at the hotel by 12 noon bcoz check-in was a breeze and there's already an available room for us! And so we were checked-in early and, to our surprise, our room was so spacious and has complete in-room and kitchen facilities! The king-size bed was so soft and comfy. We loved it soo much bcoz its"
23,December 2019,A staycation treat,NA,40,"It is always a nice treat to stay at Joy Nostalg and this stay was just as good as other stays my family had with them in the past.  We stayed at a 1 bedroom suite which was roomier than most suites within the Metro.  The room was clean and staff has been great.  We did have an issue with the bathtub where the faucet was leaking but after a quick call to guest services, they had someone from their maintenance team fix it within 30 minutes.  What I love a lot about this hotel is that it is very near The Podium mall (walking distance).  So you can stay at the hotel and if you want to go around, the mall is always a good place to hang out.  Overall, a good place to have a staycation with the family."
24,December 2019,4-star comfort to paradise,NA,40,"I was amazed by the interior, decors and design of the entire hotel. But what saddens me is the receptionist service. Three receptionists whom I have approached to were not consistent in giving information such as parking ticket fee, voucher privileges and additional head count for breakfast meal. Upon check out, I did clarify this with one of the receptionists and advise them about the misleading infos when giving to guests."
25,December 2019,Complaint,NA,40,"During our stay last December 24, 2019 occupants beside our room was having a party (I think) and is making a loud noise. I understand that its holiday and Christmas but its already 3am in the morning.   Me and my family did not enjoyed our sleep as we normally do during our stay"
26,December 2019,Parking was Abysmal,NA,30,"I’ve always enjoyed my previous stays in Joy Nostalge in Pasig City.  This year however was very unsatisfactory.   We arrived an hour early to have our car parked by valet an hour in advance of the designated check in time.   We were told that paling was full.  Thinking that maybe it’s because we are too early, we parked our car temporarily in the nearby mall.  However by 7pm, the situation was still the same.  When we complained to the front desk, her curt answer was “our policy for parking is first come first served”.  Totally ridiculous. I was forced to bring my car back to the house and just too a cab to go back to the hotel.  It didn’t feel like  a “staycation” "
27,November 2019,Awesome facilities,NA,50,"The hotel was booked for a conference and I was given a suite with two bedrooms, kitchen, living room, three TVs, Two Bathrooms etc etc. The facilities were excellent and the breakfast was great. But the most striking one was the personal care taken by the crew. When I was having breakfast, I took an egg from the Buffet thinking that it was hard boiled but it was raw. When I saw that I was mistaken, I just shrugged and left it. By magic, two boiled eggs were by my side, the next minute. One of the waiters had noticed my expression and he brought the eggs to my table immediately. The next day when I was seated, he said, "" I will bring you some boiled eggs Mam"" and brought them without even my asking."
28,December 2019,re: A wonderful Hotel.,NA,50,    The room with the bathroom i stayed in were very clean. The hotel personnel are very attentive & very helpful. The internet service was very good. Breakfast at the restaurant was not only myriad but plentiful.
29,December 2019,Awesome Accommodation,NA,50,"Great location, very close to shopping and other amenities.  Stayed in Executive One Bedroom with separate dining and living room.  It's like home away from home.  Will definitely stay again when I go back for a visit."
30,December 2019,Overall service is 1 star!!!!,NA,20,"For fur parents, we highly recommend this place. But for family staycation or special occasions, NO. Great place with spacious rooms with great room amenities (condo like rooms) Hospitality service of this hotel/ seevice apartment is a 1 star for us. Valet personnel took 25 mins to get  the car, we came down to the lobby earlier coz we want to leave early for us not to ve late with our appointment, but because of the delay with the valet service, we travelled late. Take note, we are the only guest waiting at the lobby for the valet service. Their reason, it was gotten from Basement 7. (okay, pagmukhain nyo kaming tanga) Next, parking space is a first come first serve basis not to mention, maliit parking spaces nila. Isang maling park, di ka na makakalabas ng sskyan mo. Parking"
31,December 2019,Great stay at Joy Nostalg,NA,50,"We got a 2 bedroom suite and the room was spacious, with comfortable beds and a large main bathroom plus one smaller bathroom.  The kitchen is fully equipped and the TV has its own speaker system.  Breakfast was very good and had the most number of vegetable / vegetarian options I've seen compared to other hotels in the city.  Location is excellent, walking distance to Podium if you want to go shopping or need to buy some essentials.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  I would say that it's the best value for money hotel in the area, especially if you have a large family and need a bigger space.  Would definitely recommend."
32,December 2019,Pleasantly surprised. But disappointed with lack of parking,NA,40,"Arrived late at night to a guard who said that parking is full and just shrugged when I ask what we do about it. Afterwards, he just told me to park in another building across the hotel.  Good thing everything else about the hotel made up for that poor attitude by the guard. Front desk staff courteous and efficient. Rooms were clean and spacious. Beds and pillows so comfortable. Ordered room service for breakfast and it was delicious. "
33,December 2019,Truly a Second Home,NA,50,"The Joy Nostalg Manila is truly the epitome of a five star hotel. The rooms are enormous with a lot of amenities such as a washer/dryer, dish washer, and much more. The staff are truly welcoming and hospitable. The will tend to your every needs regardless of the time of day. I had the privilege of staying at this hotel for 174 days and I would like to conclude the staff are extremely consistent with their services.   The front desk staff exhibits a positive energy that has the ability to rejuvenate anyone’s dreadful day. Their friendly smiles and sincere greetings can melt the negative energy right off a person.   I can still remember a friendly tall jolly front desk fellow by the name of Jon. It was approximately 9:00 P.M. and there were at least 13 people waiting in line. Jon"
34,December 2019,1 night is not enough,NA,50,we stayed last Saturday. the lobby is just ok. nice front office people. the room is very nice!   - big bed. with soft pillows!  - big tv.   - the ref was around 8-9cuft. which is way more than enough for your needs. even if you plan to stay for 1 month. you can easily buy food from the nearby mall  - there is a microwave - there is a convection oven. sadly was not able to use - there is also an induction cooker.  - nice surprise was there are utensils to use for simple cooking. sadly you have to bring your own dining utensils. also plates & cups. though it is easy to remedy as you can just buy them in the mall.  - the toilet is basic but nice. towels are thick and nice to use.  - closet has an iron & ironing board. but the bathrobe has one torn pocket.  - love the sofa & big
35,December 2019,Perfect Room = Perfect Holiday,NA,50,The Two Bedroom Suite was big and beautiful. This is definitely a memorable holiday escape. We would like to thank the management for accommodating all our requests. Special mention to the peeps at Nostalgia for giving us some cooking oil. We ran out of supply but they where kind enough to help us. Everyone was nice and warm. These little gestures go a long way.  
36,December 2019,had an amazing week,NA,40,"rooms were huge! as in huge! 😍😍😍 loved the tv infront of the tub ❤️ a dishwasher and washing machine!! impressive 😀😀😀 indoor pool was super nice too! breakfast...so much choices! and yummy too! only problem was, there were only a few servers and u have to wait for a long time for your coffee or hot choco :( "
37,December 2019,Almost great.,NA,30,"Room, buffet and location is great! However, I waited 30minutes or more for just a simple cappuccino and Cafe latte order. They completely forgot about me and had to reorder it again. I felt bad especially I was with a client. An opportunity that I know can be improve. "
38,December 2019,Perfect for convention ,NA,50,"Is currently staying at a one bedroom suite at joy nostalg hotel for convention. They have 229 rooms and suites and a one bedroom suite is about 86 square meters and has complete amenities that you see in a one bedroom condominium such as kitchen, microwave oven, large refrigerator, washing machine, large drawers and closet and large and separate shower and tub shower. Complimentary 2 bottled water, complimentary toiletries, complimentary parking, complimentary buffet breakfast at nostalg restaurant at 5th floor. All for about 6,000 pesos a day. "
39,June 2019,Amazing hotel and friendly staff!!,NA,50,I stayed at this hotel for 3 months while away on business and the hotel was amazing. The staff made me feel like home especially being there for 3 months. Don was one of the most friendly staff members and always treated me with smiles and laughter. He made my experience that much more pleasant.
40,April 2019,A wonderful experience made better by a fantastic team,NA,50,"My wife and I stayed at the Joy Nostalg for 7 months whilst undertaking a business assignment in Manila. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. The team who work there are wonderful, from Carlo, Mark and Sam on the lobby desk, Abi in customer experience, CJ the room attendant and Johnson at the rooftop bar, nobody could have done any more to make it feel like home.   I would love the Joy Nostalg to consider optimising the roof space during the day to cater for guest who crave the outdoors as there is little space to sit out locally. I think the roof bar could double up as a day time leisure area too,  All in all, a fabulous experience made better by a wonderful team of accommodating staff.   Thank you Joy Nostalg."
41,November 2019,Problems That Were Resolved,NA,50,There were various situations and problems that were resolved by the staff.  The JNM staff were very pleasant and did everything possible to resolve my issues.  I highly recommend this facility and will stay there again.
42,November 2019,Loved it,NA,50,"I was in Manila for a work trip and was booked into Joy-Nostalg for a 3 week stay. Having not been told anything by my fellow colleagues, I had no idea what kind of place I was being sent to. Well, it turns out that this is a bloody awesome hotel. I was I a single bedroom and it was massive. When I wasn’t at work or out shopping I was just hanging out in the pool or spa loving life. The WiFi was fantastic and much better than the 4G I was using. The first week I was just ordering room service each night, though at the end of the first week I decided to eat upstairs in the restaurant on the 6th floor or the roof top bar (both were amazing). The staff are all super friendly and will go well out their way to help you with what ever you need. Most nights (room service or the"
43,November 2019,Excellent and Friendly Staff,NA,50,All of the staff are friendly and accommodating specially the receptionist Mark who helped out on our convenient stay. I highly recommend this hotel! It’s really clean and safe. The price for the stay and food are all worth it. We’ll definitely comeback! :)
44,November 2019,People are making the difference,NA,50,"When you book a room in one of the Accor accommodations you have expectations, especially when they highly recommend this place on their site. So I was not impressed when the reception helped me with all my questions in perfect English, the room was spacious and clean, I had fast internet, complete breakfast, most tasteful and fresh buffet for diner, perfect prepared cocktail, ...  The only reason I do the effort to write this review is because of the staff in general; Nikko and Hope in specific. They made my stay very enjoyable! Thanks gentlemen and I realy hope your managers are reading the reviews."
45,October 2019,Still my home away from home but...,NA,40,"I’ve been staying here whenever I’m in Manila since 2014 and consider this as my home away from home. There’s just something about Joy Nostalg that makes me less homesick. The convenience to major malls, places to see and things to do can’t be beat. One of the factors I stay is the service, the staff is really great and I feel taken cared of. I see familiar faces which is comforting to me.  I love the breakfast buffet on the 6th floor and pleasantly surprised to find Filipino breakfast fares such as tinapa, salted egg, longanisa and taho. Been requesting this in my previous reviews, glad to finally see them on the menu. Please include lugaw, bihon and tuyo in your repertoire.  The reason for the 4 stars is the place is showing its age. The furniture, the rug are all showing"
46,October 2019,Good pet friendly hotel,NA,50,We needed a place to stay as we relocated from Hong Kong with our small dogs. The hotel was excellent however when we needed to extend a few days they were fully booked.  A good location provided you dont mind walking a bit.  Staff and room very nice . 
47,November 2019,Great Stay,NA,40,Very easy to book and reserve. Our request for early check in and late check out was granted. Rooms was very clean and spacious. Housekeeping was very accommodating with our requests. Pool was heated and my kids enjoyed it.
48,November 2019,Very nice hotel with great staff.,NA,50,"Loved the place.  Huge rooms.  Good breakfast.  Really nice staff (Sandy, the duty manager was exceptional)......Highly recommended.    5 stars all the way, and terrific value.  I stayed in the one-bedroom, and seriously, this is the kind of place you could live in forever.  Two minor notes to the management to make the place even better.  1) Add more outlets near the bed.  There literally are none available, so you can't charge your phone at night if you want it next to you.  2) Add more chairs around the pool.  They're only a very few, and that would make the pool experience much better.  I'll come again.  Very very pleasant stay."
49,July 2019,"Nice room and spacious,, but it feels old and dark",NA,30,The amenities and equipment in the  are worth the money specially the washing machine. The room is spacious and nice but it feels old and dark specially in the hallway. But overall I enjoy my stay. Friendly staff and accommodating. See you soon!
50,October 2019,Superb Stay,NA,50,"Excellent customer service, you will feel like a king. The room I got (Executive Studio) is clean when I entered. Everything is working. You can even cook your own dish or wash your laundry. Breakfast is also superb. Lot's of Bacon, Eggs, Friend Rice, Breads, and other stuffs. They even have taho on their lineup."
51,October 2019,Still good,NA,30,"Still a good place to stay, but I  experienced some issues this time. Mold Spots in the shower cabin. The hotel replaced bottled drinking water by a water filter. The instruction claims that it removes bacteria. But my question to the Guest Service about the removal of chemical impurities in the drinking water was never answered. In both suites the thermostate of the air condition was not working. It was either on with full power and it became too cold. Or it was off and the room was too warm."
52,August 2019,JOYous Experience,NA,50,"This was the first time I had my quick dinner at Joy Nostalg. The food was served exactly on time. The staff are very accommodating, they were all efficient, helpful and friendly. The best service I have ever experienced. Service was truly excellent. Will definitely be back! Highly recommended!"
53,October 2019,Celebration time,NA,40,"My wife used her membership for an overnight stay cation and celebrate our son's birthday. This suite is quite impressive as with the ff factors: Near to podium mall and Robinsons galleria Ideal suite for a family with kitchen, washing machine a sofa and enough room for a family of 5 Indoor swimming pool Nice buffet breakfast on the 6th flr Ideal location for those who may want to have functions or seminar in Ortigas.  Overall it is great to stay here."
54,December 2018,Best pet-friendly hotel in the country,NA,50,"Was there several times with my parents and fur baby. I believe that this is the only one of the best pet-friendly hotels in the country, and even my little shih-tzu enjoyed our stay! Good food and staff service is great. Will be back again soon!"
55,September 2019,Enjoyable Stay,NA,40,Stayed here for one night for a birthday celebration. The staff were friendly and courteous. My request for a late check-out was granted. The room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast venue is beautiful too. 
56,September 2019,Joyful at Joy Nostalg,NA,40,"Excellent customer service by all the hotel staff. The two bedroom suite is really spacious (131 sqm) with full kitchen. The bathroom of the master’s bedroom has bathtub, T.V. and in shower steam. The Beds and pillows are so comfy. I heared this is a pet friendly hotel. Buffet breakfast is great. We will definitely be back. 🙂"
57,September 2019,Great Big 2-bedroom suite,NA,50,stayed overnight on Sept 26-27 on a 2 bedroom suite under their anniversary promo.. Room is big & has all the amenities. Staff are generally friendly.  location is great just across ADB & a walking distance to Podium & Robinson's Galleria.  Value for money
58,September 2019,Great hotel for longer stays,NA,40,"I‘m staying at the Joy-Nostalg for about 3 weeks in both the one and two-bedroom suites. They are comfortable and well-priced, with very responsive front desk and housekeeping staff. The breakfast buffet keeps things interesting, with dishes rotating daily (even the layout seems to change often). The Filipino items at the restaurant are exceptionally tasty, the lechon and pork kare-kare at dinner especially.   Also appreciated is how they have live music in the bar, barbecues on the roof, weekly trivia nights, and other touches to help prevent boredom from creeping in on these long business trips. This month is the hotel’s 10th anniversary and they put on a 2-hour gin buffet at the bar (pictured) for about $15USD, which was amazing value and well organized. Thanks to all the"
59,September 2019,Absolute Luxury,NA,50,"I’ve traveled to 30+ countries, hundreds of cities and stayed in some of the nicest accommodations. The Joy Nostalg is probably the most beautiful experiences I’ve ever had in terms of accommodations 10/10. Couldn’t recommend it further. The very friendly staff, the delicious food, and of course the lovely manager of marketing Kyra showed us a fantastic stay! See you next time :)"
60,September 2019,Staycation ,NA,40,"I love the size of the room. It’s huge and clean. It has it’s own kitchen, dining and living room. The cut is like a 1 bedroom apartment unit.  The staff are all friendly. I have no complaint abt them. What i’m pissed about is the price of the Pancit.  I had lunch in the restaurant and ordered lechon kawali with rice and caffe mocha. The bill is just P600.  Dinner, i craved for pancit so i asked room service for pancit with lots of lemon. The price is P900 !? I can’t believe it.  It’s already served so i didn’t  have the chance to change my order. I ordered it without asking for the price. I just found out after.   For foreigners reading this, you wont understand why i’m so shocked with the price. It is only 1 plate good for 2 pax. I would accept if it’s around 400 to 500 hotel"
61,August 2019,Nice Staff,NA,50,"To Santi, Joy, Micher and Sam, these are the few people i met, thank you for all the accommodation. It was my birthday, You made my day. thats why i will always go back to your hotel. To the manager whom i  talk to on how he handle the situation thnaks. "
62,June 2019,Always a pleasant stay!,NA,50,"Great location in Ortigas! Large 1bdrm suite. Rooms were clean, odor free and comfortable.  Walking distance or quick drive via Grab to the Podium, MegaMall, Shangri-la plaza. Pool is just the right size for my son to get some laps in. Friendly and courteous staff."
63,August 2019,Great stay,NA,50,I really enjoyed the stay there. I stayed 3 nights and I put the no service sigh up - as it was so comfortable just  as it was - and it's better on the environment!! The Restaurant staff were great to - they just wanted to please every time. I'll return someday!

65,August 2019,Good service and friendly staff,NA,40,"Check-in very efficient. Room was large with a nice clean kitchen, lounge area, sleeping area,dressing area and bathroom. All very clean, if not a little dated. Food was ok but nothing special, however both the bar and restaurant staff were very attentive and friendly. Philippine body massage was fantastic in the hotel spa. Great location for business area with the SM Mall, Robinson’s Galleria and the Podium all within minutes walking distance and the Greenhills Shopping Mall a short taxi ride away. "
66,August 2019,Excellent first stay. Definitely wont be the last.,NA,50,Studio room was wonderful! Reservation team was accommodating when we advised of a late check in. Pamela at the front desk was very helpful in briefing us of what we need and ensured us of a smooth check in and check out. Room was very clean and Nostalgia service was top notch. Staff was courteous and friendly. Already considering to book during Christmas and New Year with family. Thank you for making our birthday stay memorable.
67,July 2019,Great location,NA,50,"Great location for this hotel, close to main location and offices. Amazing very large suites, the biggest I have stayed at. Staff were all friendly aswell as the security staff. Felt very safe at the hotel. Security staff always opened the door for me each day, this me feel good."
68,May 2019,Gold Class Experience,NA,50,"This is my favorite family staycation venue. Let me count the reasons why. First, almost all the staff greet me by first name basis which makes me feel highly valued and very welcome. Second, they always grant my requests like early or late check in, buckets of ice and other requests with utmost efficiency and warmth. I don’t have to ask twice, Third, topnotch facilities from the comfy beds to the fully equipped kitchen, laundry and bath tub which I only normally experience in suite rooms of expensive hotels. Fourth is the convenient location and proximity to three malls. And finally, what makes me book here always is th excellent overall experience which makes me cherish my gold status. Feels like am a platinum member even."
69,June 2019,"A hotel doesn't allow you to complain on anything, a perfect location overlooking ADB",NA,50,"You get a surprise when you open to a large suite room, it is actually a 1 BR apartment with all the amenities in place. You just need to cross the road to walk in to ADB HQ in Manila. The staff were very well trained and extremely professional. They never let you complain on anything, you just request your requirement, you will get it. The hotel has a nice restaurant. The breakfast was awesome, i could try all the local food in my 5 days stay and the chef guided me on those local dishes as well. The bathroom has even a steam option. Th reception staff are extra careful of the guests and their security. I strongly recommend this hotel for traveller's visiting ADB. The neighbourhood is also nice for local shopping malls and restaurants."
70,June 2019,A Gem in Ortigas,NA,50,"Stayed in a 1Br room for the night. Room was spacious, clean and staff was friendly. Short walk to the nearby mall (Podium) and across ADB. Tho more of a business hotel I don't mind spending a family weekend staycation due to its promixity to Megamall, Podium or Galleria.  They also have an indoor pool for your laps. Or for the kids to play in. "
71,June 2019,Literally your home away from home ❤️,NA,50,"We organized my dad’s 65th surprise bday party at the Greenhouse, one of the function rooms at The Roof (the hotel’s rooftop bar). -view was and still is amazing -food was great -staff were awesome (one of the best in all the hotels I’ve been to, including those in other countries) shout-out to Dunhill, Don, Kaye, and the rest of the staff who made sure my dad had a memorable celebration! He loved it!  We also stayed at their 2br and 3br suites, which is very spacious, clean, and well-kept. The staff had arranged for a small cake to welcome my dad once we checked-in. I think that the memorable things are in those small details, so thank you!  The hotel’s suites are spacious and well worth it given their price point. I have stayed here numerous times both with friends and family"
72,June 2019,"Old, dated, jam packed",NA,30,"Good: - we got a 2br suite and it was very spacious - had all the amenities needed for long staying guests or those who want to cook/do laundry. - comfortable beds & pillows - very near podium & megamall so its easy to do a quick run to the malls.  Not so good: - The rooms did not feel very clean, the interior is dated.  - When we checked in for the weekend, it was packed! The lobby looked like a market place, i was shocked. So if you’re looking for exclusivity and utmost privacy, forget it... - My son wanted to swim, when they went down to the pool, it was packed again! To the point where you question if its still hygienic to swim in the water given the number of people & kids. There were many individuals just hanging out there and it didn’t feel safe or relaxing - it felt like"
73,June 2019,Very Satisfied Customer,NA,50,We enjoyed staying at Joy-Nostalg that's why we're always looking forward to come back on the said hotel. One of the most memorable staff that I won't forget is Rael of Housekeeping. When we asked him to clean our room he was able to clean our room thoroughly. He is very friendly and very accomodating. Same with the woman in the front desk whose name is Joy. She amaze me because I did not ask for a cake when we checked-in. But she did ask me if we have a celebrant and I told him that it's my husband's birthday. When we arrived to our room I was so surprised that they have prepared a cake for him. She's so sweet! She really made my day. Kudos to the staff of Joy-Nostalg. We'll definitely come back. 
74,March 2019,Much improved from our last stay,NA,40,"Definitely a much improved stay, compared to our stay in 2018. Location is a plus for this hotel. Walking distance to the commercial area \ malls. Friendly and courteous front desk, concierge and staff. Still a relatively slower check-in vs. other hotels we have visited. Safe and secured. We asked for assistance to help our make-up artist come up to our room. Request for late check-out was granted as we were all preparing for our daughter's graduation ceremony at a nearby venue. Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms. Delicious breakfast buffet as always. Check-out process was faster."
75,June 2019,"I can call it ""home"" away from home.",NA,40,"A place I can temporarily call ""home"". The 5-day stay was really good and my daughter has a very good over-all experience. The TV reception has to be improved. I prefer a brighter room so LED lighting is recommended. Variety of choices at breakfast could be improved. Faster delivery of luggage to the room will be appreciated. A place to come back for a stay.."
76,April 2019,Worth Knowing,NA,20,"I booked almost 10 months in advance so thankfully didn’t pay full price. I booked for two adults and two children and was given a king bed. I asked for a roll out bed as 4 of us in one bed would not work. I was told it was an additional 1,000php a night! I had to speak to three members of staff before they finally agreed to provide with no charge. They said the room was for 4 people only yet I was not arguing that I just wanted all 4 of us to have somewhere to sleep! On another night we found dog pooh in the corridor to our room. The hotel is dog friendly. I called reception and they sent someone up to remove it but they did not clean it just removed the poop and there was still poop smudged into the carpet. The washer/dryer was useful but left the clothes smelling bad so had"
77,May 2019,Amazing experience,NA,50,I spent a little over a month and the accommodations were great. The staff will go above and beyond to assist you and they work as a family. Gilbert and Krizzia are the best! I will never forget my experience in Manila!
78,May 2019,Could have been a perefect stay,NA,40,"I stayed in this hotel and rented a 1 bedroom suite for a short Project for June, 2019.    I had a big of concern upon arriving in the hotel.  The hotel could not initially accomodate an early check in due to huge Number of guests over the weekend, despite being requested a few days prior to stay.  This was understandable.  The rest of the stay was as expected of an Accor Brand: Clear and spacious rooms and 5 Star service.  I brought my car with me to ease my way through the following day due to work.  The hotel can accomodate one car per room: which could also be undertandable.   What was quite unfortunate was when I left the hotel for a short Drive and came back, the hotel said that there was no more parking Space since the hotel shares the same spaces with the other offices"
79,May 2019,Overnight,NA,20,"Room we got was spaceous and pool area was nice. But thats it.   Hotel is Not kid friendly 1. The cabinets have no locks 2. Theres no play area for kids 3. Pool has No shallow area 4. Limited dishes for in room dining  We ordered arroz caldo for my son and we found egg shell and hair strand at our food.  When we requested for bucket of ice, it was given to us in a plastic bag.. as if it was bought from a nearby convenience store.   "
80,May 2019,Home In The City,NA,50,"Oddly enough, the hotel shares the same building as one of my former companies. Nevertheless, it has been a very comfortable stay. The location is near the malls, there is a heated indoor pool, there are free alcoholic welcomw drinks and the rooms are very nice. As it also functions as a condotel, the rooms are equipped with a full kitchen and a washing machine.   Overall, it was a pleasant stay.  Overall, it "
81,May 2019,Home in Manila,NA,50,"Happens to be in Manila again and it’s always nice to book all suite/residence hotel here. Stumbled upon Joy-Nostalg and I remember this area was shortlisted before in previous visits here.   Upon check-in, the lobby is straight forward – no frills that includes the rooms hallways as well. But the room, the luxurious feel immediately making you feel like home. From the nicely decorate living room and really comfortable couch to the amazingly comfortable bedroom with super comfy sheets to the awesome bathroom that equips with its own steam room and bath with tv. There’s also a full equip kitchen for those who prefers to cook.   There’s also an indoor pool which is good for this area since Manila is famous for their pollution.   All in all, it is indeed a really pleasant stay and"
82,April 2019,One of the best staycations in Manila!,NA,50,"Come on! You don't have to be extravagant to enjoy a staycation with superb facilities in a handy location. We stayed many times in Joy and the accommodation is one of the best. Everything is organised from the point of booking, air transfer, checking in until returning back to the airport. The staff are always helpful. I would like to say thank you to Front Desk - Pamela, Clarissa, Karen and Micher for making our transactions seamless. And also to Chef Carlos in accommodating my son's diet. Thank you so much and we will return soon!"
83,April 2019,Fabulous Hotel,NA,50,Absolutely fabulous. Everything from our room (a one bedroom suite) to breakfast and the pool. Also there was a small Mini-Mart just across the road to stock our Fridge with cheap drinks. The buffet breakfast was one of the best I have had and all three of us including a 7 year old enjoyed our stay.
84,April 2019,Wonderful Stay,NA,50,"I booked the 2 bedroom suite for my entire family. While it took some time to prepare our room after check-in, we had an amazing time during our stay. The suite was in pristine condition, the kitchen was complete with every cooking tool we needed. The staff were also very accommodating and very prompt though we know that the hotel was full packed because we stayed on a holy week. "
85,April 2019,Family Getaway,NA,40,"I’ve heard from a friend that Joy-Nostalg is a nice hotel. So for my birthday, I tried to check this out.  It was quite pricey compared to the hotels I’ve been to within the vicinity (except for Edsa Shangri-la) but a part of me just want to try it.  Here are my thoughts:  1. The reception area was beautiful. You can really feel that this place is quite new or well-maintained.  The staff are nice. They even asked if it was our first time and it was.  For a moment I thought they would give us a free updgrade but didn’t. 😊  2. The size of the room was a typical standard/superior/deluxe room but it was designed strategically.    At first glance, you will see kitchen area next to a small living area then beds.  But as you make a quick tour, at the back of the TV there is a big"
86,April 2019,Nice Hotel,NA,50,"nice hotel, big comfortable room, nice location. But the scent in your hallway each time we go out from the lift leading to the room is not good. Maybe you can change your air freshner . It doesn't smell good"

Pamela aerra who check me in, she’s so cute and very professional, she even manage all my request. mr.

It was a great stay. Kudos to all name mentioned, again guys thank you "
88,April 2019,Awesome - Great stay!,NA,50,"It starts with a quick and friendly e-mail corresponse when asking about a lift from the airport to the hotel. Followed by a warm welcome. Huge, well equipped and clean rooms. Great Breakfast. You should try roof top bar enjoying a phenomental view!  Everyone is so kind and customer orientated. "
89,February 2019,Phenomenal Customer Service,NA,50,"The hotel is employed with highly trained and kind staff members. One that stands out is a young man named Gilbert. He always has a smile on, is respectable, and professional. Great asset to the team!"
90,February 2019,Everything  you need for a comfy stay!,NA,50,"A hotel that is like a serviced apartment - with a full sized kitchen with all the cooking implements, refrigerator, family size washer and dryer, a proper dining area, huge living room with entertainment, 2 bath tubs, rain shower, comfy beds and pillows, wardrobe, full length mirrors, etc.  We booked the 3 bedroom suite for a wedding prep, and the space was enough for the dozens of people making up the entourage and their family and friends.  The hotel was very nice in letting us extend our stay as the filming for the wedding video was not yet finished.  There's free wifi but very limited access. And the view from the windows were skyscrapers under construction.   Nevertheless, this is a quality hotel for family or big group get togethers; your balikbayan friends and relatives"
91,March 2019,First Time Stay and Most Memorable,NA,50,"This is my first time stay in Manila and I am impressed with the service and small detail of care that Joy Nostalg provided to me. I greatly appreciate the care provided by The Front Office Manager, Eyra Carlos, for ordering a special ""snack"" for me, despite knowingly that I would be a challenge for me to find. Traveling as part of the Canadian delegation that had our conference hosted by the hotel and also as a platinum member, I greatly appreciate this ""small detail"" of attention that makes my experience memorable and unforgettable. Thank-you Erya and her team for making my stay ""excellent"". I look forward to returning back to Joy Nostalg in my next visit to Manila.      "
92,March 2019,overall very good but with a couple drawbacks,NA,40,"This is an extended stay sort of property with a full kitchen.  There was a table in front of the sofa that could serve as a dining table, but I had to use my desk chair as the sofa is too low to eat comfortably off the table which is normal dining table height.  I used the desk chair.  The desk chair, however, is not a good work chair.  It is a dining room table chair.  The sofa is greatly appreciated as it is comfortable for relaxing, but for typing on a computer, you need to sit in the desk chair.  The hotel should have standard work chairs for that purpose.  Furthermore, in the studio units, the desk is tucked in a corner near the window with very little space, and a bit inconvenient.  It is next to the washer/dryer which is very small and the dryer part does not really"
93,March 2019,Very nice hotel with spacious rooms and lovely pool facilities,NA,50,"My first stay here became a smash hit. Although there's no executive lounge, the rooms have a fully equiped kitchen including a big refridgerator and even a washing machine. I stayed at an executive King suite, which has a separate bedroom and it was very comfortable. I loved the neighbourhood with different restaurants, 7/11 supermarkets that are open around the clock, and malls.  Check-in was very smooth and very fast. Staff are highly capable and friendly. The hotel has two entrances which is a timesaver when you want to walk outside. The room was very good. Wi-Fi connection was superior. TV has very good quality. Sofas and chairs were very comfortable. Only the aircon is too cold, even when you put it on 27°C. I just switched it off for most of the time.  I made an"
94,February 2019,Wonderful hotel!,NA,50,"We stayed here for 6 days and couldn’t be more pleased! The staff was super friendly, helpful and always available for whatever our needs might be.  We stayed in the one bedroom executive suite, it was so spacious and roomy with 3 TVs and we really enjoyed the living//dining room, it was more like a condo than a hotel room. Annet and I want to thank you for making our stay here so enjoyable. "
95,February 2019,My favourite hotel in the city,NA,50,"My favourite hotel in Manila! Perfect rooms, gorgeous breakfast, friendly atmosphere. The staff is extremely accomodating with a special mention to Ms. Kyra Cabaero, the marketing manager who is, I must say, the most delightful and professional person I have came accross. She would never run out of ideas to make sure all the guests remain entertained throughout their stay (make sure you do not miss special events organized at the bar!)"
96,February 2019,Enjoyable stay at an elegant hotel,NA,40,"There are so many good things about this hotel but I think the top on my list is the space.  The 180 sq meter 3-bedroom suite we got offered the kids a lot of space for playing.  The kitchen, the laundry area, the bedrooms, and the living room are spacious and elegantly designed.  Service was also good, with the housekeeping and room service staff responding to our requests fairly quickly, from delivering more blankets or utensils to even a small cup of cooking oil. The overall look and feel of the place is elegant yet comfy.  The breakfast buffet offered just the right amount of variety, I think-- neither restrictive nor overwhelming, plus there is bacon! The gym had good quality equipment. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen had sufficient amenities, from the oven to the"
97,February 2019,Old and Tired Hotel,NA,20,"It was an okay stay but I expected more. Understand that it is a residential property but I cant help but to compare this to Ascott Makati (tired hallway carpet), smelly room (which we did not experience in Ascott, room assigned was in front of very tired and disgusting service door, stained sheets, VERY POOR room service menu considering the prices of food being offered - so cheap!, untidy and old table mats in bfast area but Id like to commend the expat F&B Manager for being so accommodating I would not go back unless the hotel will be renovated soon."
98,January 2019,"Well Designed Rooms, Friendly staff",NA,30,"Stayed for a month at this hotel. The long stay room are thoughtfully designed with storage, cooking facilities and a convenient washer dryer and have views and light.  The rates typically include breakfast which is good but the menu does not vary much.  Staff is friendly and tries to be helpful but service is slow.  Health club is dark and the pool is crowded.  The spa is small.  Even at the lower long stay rates, the hotel is less value for money than other options in the area at the same or lower price point which is why I rated it as average."
99,December 2018,Outstanding hotel  let down by one very big flaw,NA,20,"Overall our stay was mixed.  The best things about this hotel were the fantastic spacious rooms with excellent amenities, great Accor Le Club Platinum loyalty benefits, above average gym, and friendly staff.  Unfortunately, the hotel has one very big flaw, and that is that smoking is allowed in the hotel bar which is attached to the hotel restaurant meaning the entire restaurant area (including the area where breakfast is served) stunk of pungent disgusting smoke. It was absolutely repulsive! It is hard to believe that in 2018 when smoking is illegal in hotels in so many countries that there are hotels which still allow smoking – not just in private rooms - but in public areas where people are consuming food. There was no one smoking at breakfast, however the smell from the"

101,January 2019,Nice and comfy,NA,50,"Friendly staff, clean room, comfy bed, good location close to shops, restaurants and big department store. We have enjoyed the indoor pool and spa. Breakfast is good but pricey for kids if not included in the room. Overall great and will be back."
102,June 2018,A Home away from Home. ,NA,50,"The Joy Nostalg Hotel is what made me fall in love with Manila. I was completely blown away by how welcome I felt. There was nothing but happiness and excellent customer service during my 3 month business trip in 2018. The resteraunt provided a variety of comforting foods and beverages while playing warm and inviting music every day. House keeping cleaned with a smile and always made sure that the room was perfect. Last but certainly not least, the front desk staff offered amazing quality assistance whenever called or spoken to. The entire staff was befriending and I am very grateful to have experienced this top tier hotel. A special thanks to some of the staff in particular whose services and character really stood out: Glydel, Hope, Johnson, and Mac from the resteraunt/bar."
103,October 2018,Like coming home,NA,50,I love coming to this hotel. I have stayed here about 5 or 6 times. I am greeted so warmly every time. It really feels like coming home.  The 1 bedrooms suites are huge! so expansive.  The studio rooms are comfortable.  Having a kitchen and laundry facilities in your room is so convenient. What I really love about this hotel is the staff. They are so friendly and remember me every time I visit. Nothing is too much trouble and always done with a smile.  I can't wait to check out the new rooftop space.  The area itself is mall after mall. Great for shopping and with so many food options.  I strongly recommend this hotel for a stay in Ortigas.
104,December 2018,Chill and Homey Staycation,NA,50,"It was my christmas break, just in time my friends and I thought of checking in Joy-Nostalg. When we first entered the room it was definitely clean and tidy, I loved the view which we had from our room. My friends and I enjoyed our stay we were able to spend quality time together after so long. Our requests were definitely accommodated by the hotel staff also I would like to commend Ms. Karen of the Front Desk for her honesty. She gave me back the extra cash that I was about to pay for our room fee I really appreciated this kind of good deed from her. I would definitely comeback for another staycation."
105,December 2018,One of the Best!,NA,50,"I would say this is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in Manila. I really like the idea of having a TV in-front of the bath tub. I was able to really relax and enjoy my tub moment. Really love the sauna inside the shower. Rooms are spacious and clean. Other than that staff are really nice, place is very convenient to the spots we wanted to explore. Must come back for more."
106,April 2018,The place on earth,NA,50,The room was huge with a lot of amenities. I am definitely going to stay there again... the selection on breakfast was great all international and all the staff where accomodating and very hospitable.
107,January 2019,Home away from home,NA,50,"We have stayed at the Joy Nostalg five times in the last seven years, for a month on each occasion. The accommodation and facilities are truly excellent, but the thing that makes it our preferred home here is the competence, responsiveness and friendliness of the management and staff. They are the best we have found anywhere in the world. "

110,January 2019,Overnight is not enough,NA,40,"Our family took a break from the frenetic Christmas holidays by staying two days at Joy Nostalg Hotel, what they call a “staycation”. The hotel’s best feauture is its location, right smack within walking distance of FOUR big malls. That means you are unlikely to order room service, unless food cravings visit in the middle of the night.  The rooms are spacious with a washer and dryer, perfect for longer stays. What got me though was the extra TV set in the bathroom! Wifi is free and acceptable.  Checking in and checking out was a breeze, even considering that we stayed in one of the peak seasons of the year. The staff is courteous, solicitous and more importantly, knowledgeable. I suppose it is ideal for business travelers always in a hurry. There is basement parking and a pay"
111,December 2018,Stay was beyond great...except for one.,NA,40,"So we stayed here for 3 days to celebrate New Year 2019. Everything was great. The rooms are spacious, homey and clean. Food: not much of selection. Location is 10/10 it is in the middle of Rob Galleria, Podium and Megamall. Parking are a bit stressful. They go on a first come first serve basis. If they ran out of slots, you park somewhere else but not in the hotel's premise. Staffs are nice and friendly. But there was ONE who made a mark. The chef at the EGG station during bfast buffet, Carlo (other staff said thats his name) was full of arrogance and throwing some attitude. I was about to get Miso Soup but noticed that it isnt hot anymore. I asked a server to please heat it and I will wait. I asked nicely, with a smile on my face just wanting to get a hot miso soup.While"
112,December 2018,a JOYful new year,NA,50,My family spent the new year’s and we are more than pleased with our stay. Staff are most welcoming and super accommodating. We can tell that it was a busy time because the lobby was full when we checked in and checked out. But it was seamless. 
113,December 2018,Long term stay,NA,50,"I recently ended my long term stay at the joy-Nostalg Jun-Dec, the friendly staff go out of their to make you feel welcomed and create a home a way from home experience.  The rooms are spectacular comfortable and with better views the higher your room is.  The amenities are top notch the gym has convenient hours and is fully equipped with everything you need for a proper workout.  The bar and restaurant have everything you need from a light snack to a quality meal with friends with entertainment most nights, Hope is a topnotch mixologist who can make any drink you desire if they have the ingredients.  If you feel like going out the Joy is only blocks from several bars and restaurants with live music.  The Joy-nostalg is a family friendly Hotel where you can feel comfortable"
114,December 2018,Short and nice,NA,40,It was a nice place but there were few concerns that was not addressed and resolved right away. And we really hoped there were always frontliners always available to answer phoe calls promptly.  They could have checked rooms before opening the rms to the guests.
115,December 2018,Want A Pet-Friendly Hotel with Excellent Accommodations?,NA,40,"Check out Joy Nostalg Manila. We stayed in a One Bedroom Executive Suite and it was spacious. The rooms are very clean and orderly. Even if they allow pets in their rooms, there was no smell nor hairs on the upholstery.  I look forward to another long weekend where I don't have to worry about my furbabies anymore. They can come along with me.   Special mention is in order also - Jake Lagar, the Duty Manager of the hotel who ironed out some issues during our stay."

To try it out for a change, I booked multiple rooms for a staycation with my entire family.   Everything about this hotel spells convenience:  LOCATION: Conveniently located in the Ortigas CBD and within walking distance of malls (Robinsons, Megamall and Podium) lots of restaurants, convenience stores and the Ortigas MRT station.  PARKING: Valet parking available, aside from basement parking on a first-come, first-served basis. There's also an open, paid parking lot right beside the hotel.

117,December 2018,Good and enjoyable stay,NA,50,Almost had a bad stay because of bill and room problem.All ended well as it was settled in minutes with their capable staff duty manager Jack and front desk staff mark.I will definite stay again on my future visits
118,November 2018,Telephone shower not working so we needed a new room.  They upgraded us but the room was smaller than our first room.,NA,30,"I booked a 1 bed room last 17 November 2018, I just had an operation so I needed to use the telephone shower. Unfortunately, it was not working. I cannot use the rain shower as my head part cannot be wet that time as per my doctor’s instruction. I contacted the receptionist and asked to fix my shower. I waited for almost 2 hours! I got pissed off as my visitors started arriving and I was not ready yet due to my shower problem. The receptionist was so rude to me instead of comforting me. She did not realise the hassle that I was experiencing that time. I spoke to the manager Ms. Eyra Carlos and she addressed my concern by upgrading my room. However, the new room was smaller than our first room.   The bed and pillows were comfortable, my friends and I enjoyed the room and the"
119,September 2018,Always a nice place for staycation,NA,50,"My whole family stayed at a 3bedroom suite and as usual this hotel never failed us. This is my favorite hotel ever. I had my bridal shower, baby shower, anniversary staycation and my mom’s bday surprise here. All the staff there were so cheerful and helpful. Always always a great place for staycation. The indoor pool was a bonus too :)"
120,December 2018,Client Meeting,NA,40,The dining are of the hotel's restaurant is a very good venue for meeting clients or small discussions.  Food varieties available in the buffet area were good.  Very attentive resto personnel added to the productive meeting we just conducted.
121,November 2018,Another great stay with some concerns,NA,40,"we had a great stay last month before and aftrr our flight to Palawan. On our first few nights everything is fantastic but after our trip there's some concerns in our room 2305. First, the toilet is a bit smelly even the exhaust is on so we always keep it close whenever we don't use it. Second, sometimes I can hear crackling sound like from the main light switch inside the bedroom. Third, when we dim the lights in the living room it always pulsating. And last, staffs in the dining area should be more attentive to their guest and should try to assist their guest especially if the guest is drunk. When we where having our breakfast the other guests helped the drunk guy first before the crew help him.   The food and amenities are still great. We will still stay here in the near"
122,November 2018,Acceptable but can definitely be improved,NA,30,"I had really high expectations in coming to this hotel - with its great reviews and ratings.  I have stayed with my mother on December 1 (during the long weekend) and I can say that our overall stay is acceptable but not quite impressive (or maybe I really had high expectations resulting to some areas that indeed fell short).  Let me try to divide the areas of my review:NO ONLINE CHECK-IN FACILITY SIMILAR WITH OTHER ACCOR HOTELS - As compared with other Accor hotels that I have stayed in, which allowed me to check in earlier making sure that my key card is ready in the Priority desk, Joy Nostalg does not have this option available.  I made sure to check it with Customer Service on the day itself, as I thought I may have just missed an e-mail. The kind lady from Customer Service"
123,October 2018,Spacious and Comfortable,NA,40,"The price for the room is pretty decent especially with how it is centrally located and has a full functioning kitchen. Breakfast selection isn't that much though, so it's probably best to utilize the kitchen and cook your own. Anwyay, I will definitely stay here again."
124,November 2018,Special thanks to Nostalgia Lounge Bar (Hope and Mac),NA,50,"Services were at high level. Hotel room and lounge bar are attractive. Hotel staff are polite, helpful and professional (especially Nostalgia Lounge Bar and Reception). But still breakfast is limited. Many thanks."
125,November 2018,Nostalgia Restaurant at the 6th floor,NA,40,"I Had a couple of business meetings at the restaurant. Service and friendliness of the staff is top notched. Nothing to improve there as it is already excellent.  They take their coffee seriously selecting a good blend to serve their customers.  The only thing i like to complain is that the have a smoking lounge on the 6th floor, and I can smell the cigarette smoke. The odour is strongest at the bar area. If you have allergies, you may want to avoid the 6th floor."
126,November 2018,Appreciating dining service,NA,40,"Good day! Just want to commend the waiter named Jeric and Chef bak or chef beck, for providing us separate dish ( chicken sausage and thai chicken), since i told the waiter Jeric, that for people like us who dont eat pork, what are our options? They served nice dishes, but majority are pork.. the waiter talked to me politely and told me, that we can request fo non pork food,, so he told the chef, and gladly the chef brought me a newly cooked thai chicken.. just want to say thank you.. by the way, 1 bedroom suite is really nice.."
127,October 2018,Business Trip,NA,40,Stayed at the Hotel for a business trip.  The rooms were large and spacious with kitchen.   The hotel was comfortable however the building construction noise from the site across the road continues all night.  Would recommend they don't allocate the front rooms as they get the worst of the noise.  Restaurant and Bar were both good.
128,August 2018,Home away from home,NA,40,"The hotel was a serviced apartment hence every room has a kitchen with oven, microwave oven, kitchen hood, coffee maker, electric kettle, kitchen cabinets with kitchen utensils, plates, dishes, spoons, forks and knives. It also has a large fridge, washer/dryer, large LCD TV with sound bar and clock radio. It is an ideal hotel for long stays.  Steam in shower, shower with large shower head.  Free wifi but limited to 3-4 devices. You will need to ask for another USERID if you have more devices.  Gym and dining on 6/F. Excellent breakfast buffer. Expect to mingle with bankers.  Hallway a bit dim changes.  Bed sheet is changed every 3 days like a service apartment.  Front desk and Concierge staff are friendly.  The hotel is opposite Asian Development Bank so expect a lot of overseas"
129,October 2018,Definitely one of the best hotel in Manila.,NA,50,"Everything is splendid. My recommended my business partner to stay in Joy Nostalg and every single one of them give me their positive feedback. I did not regret making this choice. The room are well equip with full kitchen facilities. Not only its spacious but its also very cosy. I enjoyed my breakfast. I like the restaurant atmosphere and design. Tables have inspirational book for reading pleasure. Every single staff greeted me with a smile. Their service provided is excellent. From the Security staff to the management, all is very professional. The hotel is near to big shopping malls where u can everything u want. I will definately make this hotel my first choice whenever i go for leisure or business trip there. I would like to give my appreciation for every single staff that"
130,October 2018,Still good,NA,40,I stayed again - it must be a dozen times. The rooms are great for a short stay as they a larger than normal. The restaurant has changed the menu since the new ownership and it is an improvement. Also the bar area is more open and good to be smoke free.
131,September 2018,bowtie man in Manila,NA,50,"what a hotel, I stayed in the King Suite...………..2305fantastic, two rooms, kitchenette, shower and steam room in one, stayed in many hotel rooms this is equal to any. Shopping malls three all walking distance, train station close by.  Great value,  highly recommended . "
132,September 2018,Super friendly staff,NA,50,"This was our 2nd stay at Joy and very enjoyable indeed. The staff go out of their way to make you welcome, so yeah super friendly staff.The pool and gym are great, especially the 25m pool, soooo good for lapping. Breakfast was great and nice bar staff.We had an apartment room, so big, furnished luxuriously, we wanted for nothing.Most importantly, hotel has fast wifi.The hotel has a DVD library which we like to use; both our DVD players would not work, quickly fixed. I'm reluctant to include a negative comment, but we had the same problem last visit; so maybe these should be checked as one of the players simply did not have the HDMI cable plugged in, obviously from previous guests; the other player needed to be replaced. But in the scheme of things this was minor issue and I'm"
133,December 2017,Super massage,NA,50,"The hotel is very close to my husbands' duty travel station. He like it very much. While he was having a boring time at work, I enjoyed the pool and the massage. Would like to say THANK YOU to Attel (maybe i misspelled her name), masseuse who gave me a sports massage and relieved back pain.  Nice & friendly staff."
134,September 2018,Staycation,NA,50,Stayed here last weekend and the hotel experience was superb. The room was so big and have a lot of space. There was also a mini kitchen where in we were able to cook our midnight snack.  Their bathroom was so big and has a bath tub which my brother enjoyed so much.  Our whole experience was great. Will definitely comeback.
135,September 2018,Excellent amenities,NA,50,"This hotel has all the amenties of your house but in a 5 star way...if you dont want to use your kitchen...the restaurant serves good food with reasonable prices...we ordered the lechon kawali with crispy skin and the filipino beef called ""tapa""...all comes with rice...they dont have an executive lounge yet but we were given unlimited cocktails for 1 hour...just enough to relax and chill at the bar...special thanks to mark who gave us a tour of the hotel...i will always come back to this hotel...the kitchen in the room is a big advantage if your too lazy to eat out."
136,September 2018,A Gem in the Heart of Ortigas,NA,50,"I have often dined at Nostalgia but never got a chance to really check-in. My family and I celebrated my birthday with an overnight staycation and reserved a one-bedroom executive suite just this September. The reception was not crowded, while we were anticipating higher foot traffic because of the typhoon that weekend, accommodation was quick and seamless. When we were taken to our 10th floor suite, it was beautiful and stocked up. The best accommodation we've booked so far.  There was a basic kitchen and the living room had a comfortable and warm ambiance. View was also exciting for my 2-year old daughter. Both the living room and bedroom were very spacious. The shower room was also very well maintained and didn't seem cluttered even when they had a bathtub.   The only"
137,September 2018,Joy Nostalg Bar & Resto,NA,50,"Amazing service, food and drinks, ambience, and music from the acoustic band. Thank you for the hospitality and  most of all for Don. Our event went really so well and memorable.  We'll definitely come back. 😊 "
138,September 2018,Nostalgia Dining Lounge,NA,50,"I tried their Off the grill buffet night and had a blast with my family! They have a good selection of meat and seafood to choose from! Imagine having unlimited lamb chops for Php 1,500! The service was also excellent! Felt like a VIP care of Dunhill, Mawi, and servers Mac and Don. Will definitely come back and recommend to friends and family.  "
139,August 2018,VERY RELAXING STAY 😍😍😍,NA,50,thank you for the wonderful and memorable stay.. indoor pool was AMAZING 😍😍.. my nephew enjoyed the pool.. special thanks to LYN our attendant.. very attentive and accommodating.. it was short stay but we are planning to visit again.
140,August 2018,Very bad Experience,NA,10,"The soundproof is really bad, you can hear the noise from the construction site and also sound from next room.I was awaken up by the music and talking from my next room at midnight.The service is also poor. I pressed 'Guest Service'. The one picked the phone told me I need to call front desk and dropped my phone very impatiently. (this is the first time I was told that 'Guest Service' is not front desk, and my call was not redirected. )The room equipment is also very old.I will not stay at this hotel any more."
141,June 2018,Relaxing stay,NA,50,"Great stay!!! Our room was spacious and really nice!! It has a kitchen, a sofa where you can sleep also, cabinets, washing machine and a huge bed. Close to the mall — Podium, also to Starbucks and different convenience stores. Will surely comeback here"
142,July 2018,Training,NA,40,The hotel is strategically located in the heart of Ortigas.   The function room used during the training session is very good.   Food served at the buffet resto and the very accommodating staff made our whole day training very informative as it is expected to be.
143,August 2018,Very Good Hotel in a Very Good Location,NA,40,"We stayed one night in this hotel in an Executive Studio with King-sized Bed.   Overall, the stay is a very pleasant one. Check-in was a breeze. Mark handled our check-in and he was a bit over-enthusiastic in accommodating us. But I would take over-enthusiastic over unenthusiastic any time.  I believe the room we stayed in is the smallest they have on offer. But because the property being more of a serviced apartment type, it is still the most spacious room I have ever stayed here in Manila.It has a separate sitting area with a couch and a kitchen (with stove and oven!). The room even has a washer/dryer in it (laundry detergent is not provided though).   The bathroom is also a good size. I love hotels with a large shower area and the room has a nicely-sized shower area. The"
144,June 2018,No breakfast,NA,40,"Stayed in their 3-bedroom suites for 2 nights in June. The stay was relatively pleasant, save for the tight parking slot and no complimentary breakfast. The suite was spacious, which gave enough space for wedding suppliers to work and not give a tight spot to the people who were there.  The beds were also comfortable and were made when we got back. They also had reliable staff that you can contact after the stay to check for lost items."
145,August 2018,Home away from Home. ,NA,50,"Perfect place to stay when you want to relax. Big, clean and awesome rooms. Pool is not crowded, at night we own  the pool and jacuzzi. I like the ambiance and everything. Staffs are accommodating. Definitely reccomended. "
146,August 2018,Enjoyable Overnight Stay,NA,50,"Stayed overnight at an Executive King 1-bedroom and had a very pleasant experience. The room was spacious and clean. You could find everything you need, appliances/facilities, inside the room. The bed and all the furniture were comfortable. Staff were great and they made sure to have all our requests granted. Will definitely stay over again!"
147,August 2018,Manila stay,NA,40,Lovely service in a central location. Service at check in and at main entrance was excellent. Helped me find baggage that was left in taxi. Life saver!  Apartment was comfortable with lots of space and cosy beds.
148,August 2018,Pleasant overnight,NA,50,"We had a quick stay in a one bedroom suite. The suite is very spacious and would work for a longer stay with a washing machine and dishwasher located in the well appointed kitchen. I enjoyed the in-shower steam bath and my daughter had fun with the free standing tub (and TV).  We had dinner at the Nostalgia Lounge and there was live music. Good food, so happy with our food.  They offer a Gin Flight daily consisting of six different kinds of Gin, with mixers and appetizers. Interesting. Hope (what a nice name) makes intriguing mixes of Gin and Tonic.  Thank you Ryan, Mark and Donjay for the company. Cheers!"
149,August 2018,Recommended hotels in Pasig,NA,50,"The hotel is around 30 minutes - 1 hour from Airport depends on traffic. You should take Grab instead of airport taxi. Its very expensive about 2200 peso, while grab only 350 peso. Around the hotels are many shopping malls and restaurant. But its far if you want to go to tourist attraction like intramuros, Cathedral, etc. If you take Grab from hotel to Intramuros is around 350 peso.  I could check-in earlier on 11am. The hotel facility is good. I used the gym facilities and pool, all is in good condition. For improvement, the water in pool please dont too much chlorine.  Breakfast is also good enough. I was really enjoyed my stay here. Recommended."
150,September 2017,Excellent Facilities,NA,50,We had a small party in one of their 2-bedroom suite and the experience was wonderful. Everything we needed was already provided in the room. Service was impeccable and the hotel itself was sparkling clean. 100% value for money! 
151,July 2018,A superb venue for seminars and perfect place to windup ,NA,50,"This is my first time in this hotel. From the airport T3 i used the map.me app which easily located the hotel. I rode the yellow cab via express lane and arrive the hotel in 30 minutes and paid 230 php all in all. The staff are courteous. I was checked in with such an ease even it was inky 10 in the morning. The room was actually a pad for 2 . With complete amenities,   Kitchen sala small office and everything is put in its place perfectly. A must to everyone"
152,July 2018,Joy Nasalg Hotel ...... Who New!,NA,40,"Being west of Makati it is a bit of a drive from the airport, and even longer when it rains...took us nearly 2 hours.  Even so the Hotel is very classy and the staff were excellent and responsive to any requests.  I have no qualms recommending the Hotel for a stay as long as your comfortable with the distance or if you want 2 or more nights stay.  We stayed in a one bedroom executive apartment with kitchen and steam shower and bath which is over 80m2 in area for around $140 per night with breakfast.   Brekkie was very nice with plenty of options."
153,July 2018,"Spacious, in a very crowded city",NA,50,"Philippines  has one of the highest population density, and the space Joy Nostalg has to offer makes you not believe that. With spacious bed room and living room, Wi-Fi, kitchenette and all other amenities, my favorite is the bath. The tub is spacious too, and the shower room has an inbuilt steam, for tired days to make you sleep well. Its also centrally located in Ortigas, close to the ADB office, close to the MRT station, and close to the city's most visited place, the SM Mega Mall."
154,July 2018,Value for Money,NA,50,"The room is equipped with the standard (tv, bed, bathroom, wifi plus (Washer / Dryer, Kitchen amenities such as microwave, induction stove, rice cooker, pans, plates, glasses, wine glasses, spoon and fork and many more). It gives you an opportunity to cook your own meal and they also offer a service where in they will do the grocery for you - just fill up the grocery list form of course this comes with extra charge.   We love their indoor heated pool as well as their professional massage therapist.   The hotel is situated near major malls such as SM Megamall, Podium, Robinson’s Galleria and Ayala 30th, banks, MRT, schoola and even church. Excellent location. Very convenient.   Friendly staff.   We will surely be back.   "
155,July 2018,Best accor hotel in the Philippines with minor concerns,NA,40,"Room is fantastic super big room we had compare to the rooms we had in other Accor hotels in town. The whole interior design is magnificent, hallways to your room and in your room has big paintings. Food is fantastic and tasty. Staffs in the dining area are very attentive. One morning while we where having our breakfast there was this two Japanese kids alone and the staffs are attending to their needs. This is something I really love to see. Gym is great, it has plenty of machines for you to use. Pool is clean and doesn't have a strong smell of chlorine just like in other hotels. If you want to use Jacuzzi and sauna you need to tell it to the staffs half an hour ahead so they could heat it. This rules is great because it saves a lot of energy. Male shower room in the 6th floor"
156,July 2018,Great accomodation with some minor issues,NA,40,"I enjoyed staying in an executive suite of this hotel for several days. The very well equipped suite offered lots of space including extras like kitchen, bath with mini-sauna and washing machine. The room service and cleaniness were excellent. Noises from the street and a nearby constuction site could be noticed but were not disturbing. A dislike was the presence of biting insects on the room (I suspect them in the sofa and bed). I liked the pool and the gym that offeres a good range of training options. The food range and quality of the breakfast was excellent. Minor issues were: The hotel charges for the black&white-printing of a document 50 Pesos per page, which seems to be pretty overprized to me. I also expect that a cappuchino should be included in the breakfast of a 5star"
157,July 2018,Brilliant hotel ,NA,50,Just spent four nights for business travel and cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. Rooms are super large and the staff are all amazing - they greet you with a smile and remember your name in almost all situations - it’s a real treat  
158,July 2018,Big group,NA,30,"We booked a 3bedroom suite via agoda for a family staycation.  Some of the good things about oakwood 1. Free cot provided for our toddlers 2. Breakfast buffet included 3. Good sized pool and water is lukewarm  Not so good: 1. Our bathroom was clogged and it smelled so bad. It was not rectified immediately :(  2. The items to be used for the kitchen are not free (diahwashing liquid, sponge etc) ..  3. Free parking was for 1 car only 4. Housekeeping does not provide our requests (tissue, bucket of ice)  Ive stayed at other nearby hotels (cheaper) but with excellent service. To name a few are marco polo, discovery suites and edsa shang.   "
159,June 2018,Beyond expectations.,NA,50,"Super friendly and helpful staffs. We stayed at the Executive Studio. The room was superb. Truly modern home design with fully equipped kitchen, home entertainment, washer AND drier too! Comfort Room has it's own television set so don't bother to bring your cell in there :P .  Do check out the indoor swimming pool as well as the gym sections. For entertainment, hop over to their Nostalgia Lounge & Bar. The locality of this hotel is also convenient as there are two malls nearby in case you want to take a stroll around the area.  Thank you Joy Nostalg Hotel & Suites for the hospitality .It was a pleasant & very comfortable stay. "
160,June 2018,A joy to stay,NA,50,"Now that this hotel is Accor-managed (ex-Oakwood), I gave it a try during this business trip. From the check-in, the staff here made one feel welcomed and appreciated. The exec studio room was spacious enough for single occupancy and came with serviced apartment-type amenities like a kitchenette and washer-dryer which would be boon for longer stays. The bathroom even has a steam/hamaam feature. If I were to be picky, as I am a rather light sleeper, noise was perceptible from the next room and also the fridge. Krizzia at the breakfast room was wonderful and she was a delight to meet every morning."
161,June 2018,"Huge room, superb location",NA,50,"First time we stayed at this hotel and regretted that we had never stayed here in our previous visits to Manila, because it is just definitely value for money!   The hotel is located across of ADB complex, and only few minutes walks to SM mall and Robinsons Galleria. Literally central.  We had the One-Bedroom Suite. It was huge! the size of the bathroom itself could make up into one bedroom, and with the facilities that are available in the unit, you could actually save a lot of money staying here (if you prefer to cook your own meals and do your own laundry like us).   The restaurant on 6th floor is also nice. Had 2 dinners here, and the food was great with friendly waiters!  One thing the hotel management could consider for improvement is to allocate one floor for smoking"
162,June 2018,Staycation,NA,40,"Very nice big room. All u need is there: washing machine, iron, kitchen and they can even buy ur groceries. Loved the indoor pool with its warm water. Relaxing music too while u swim.   Pet friendly they say but I learned later that they require a big amount of money for you to be able to take your pet in the bedroom."
163,June 2018,Pure comfort at Joy Nostalg.,NA,50,We stayed for a night and wished we could have stayed longer. The room is simply awesome and fully equipped from good tv with sound system to even a washing machine inside the room !!.. The beds are comfy and clean. The hotel staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel facilities top notch and hotel location just great close to 2 big malls...
164,January 2018,Feels like home,NA,50,"My kids and I stayed here for a night, we love the homey feeling of the room since they offer full amenities, they also have a kitchen. The kids loved their heated indoor pool. We will definitely go back."
165,June 2018,Feels like homw,NA,50,"Stayed for one night with my family to celebrate my parents' anniversary. The check-in was fast, and we were able to get to our rooms quickly. We got the Executive Studio room and we were surprised how big the room is. It has a kitchen, complete with refrigerator, coffee maker, stove with oven, and microwave. It even has a washing machine. We were amazed at how they maximized the room space. We had one king bed and one sofa, both of which were very comfortable. The TV is okay though limited cable channels. The bathroom is quite spacious as well, and it also has a TV where you can watch while doing your business there.   They have an indoor pool and jacuzzi. They also have sauna and massage. We did not have breakfast here so I can't comment on that. But I got the chance to see"
166,May 2018,Excellent choice for business trips,NA,50,"My colleagues and I stayed here for a week in May 2018.   The staff are very welcoming, attentive and helpful. The transport service (airport transfers, lift to office) is very well organised - which is nice as Manila has a lot of traffic.  The hotel is centrally located and walking distance or short drive from business centers, shops, restaurants and other amenities.  The bar is very nice, with entertainment throughout the week and the Dim Sum menu is delicious.  I hope to stay here again in the future."
167,May 2018,2 Bedroom Suite that feels like home,NA,40,"This was our hotel while attending a convention on a nearby hotel. We booked a 2 bedroom suite for the 5 of us. The room is equipped with a washing machine and dryer, big refrigerator, induction cooker, rice cooker, microwave oven, toaster, kitchen utensils and a 10 seater dining table. It also has a sala with large TV. Each room has its own toilet and bath. Highly recommended for group stay."
168,May 2018,Disappointing,NA,10,"Booked in this “supposedly” quality service hotel. And after a long tiring day, at 1am the first welcome i get is, no more parking. Had to park nearby lot and walked back. If they cant take in guests with cars, then isnt cheap motels better? At least they have parking space for their guests."
169,May 2018,Nice hotel but inconsiderate staff,NA,20,"Booked a night as a gift for my friend via Accor complimentary night stay. But what disappoints me was their attachments to the rules and terms of Accor membership. They made the process hard when they could have done it in an easier and simpler way. Maybe, they have to consider the comfort and satisfaction of their guest, be it complimentary or regularly booked accommodation."
170,April 2018,Great place,NA,50,"Has a great bar staff. Hope, Mac and Mark are all great bartenders. The people who work at the front are very nice. Trivia nights and salsa night are great. Maybe add some more game nights. The jacuzzi was very cold."
171,April 2018,I stayed for 5 months. Loved every day there,NA,50,Great hotel! Hotel staff rocks! Gym and pool is nice. Hope Mac and Marc are bartending wizards. Food is pretty good. Everyone who works there is super friendly. They have live music at the bar which is great. 10/10 would recommend
172,February 2018,Outstanding Service,NA,50,"Absolutely no complaints. Beautiful rooms and amazing views of Manila the higher you go. Housekeeping was outstanding and easy to deal with. Shoutout to Mac and Hope, best bartenders in the Philippines!!"
173,May 2018,Bad breakfast,NA,30,"Strike 1: no valet 2: the parking slot given to me, there’s a car parked on it, they didn’t give me a new slot, like so what, who cares.  3: no welcome drink at least  4: the breakfast is the worst.  are they trying to make people hate eating there? congee, no taste Coffee, taste like the one served during wakes. Like its the 5th time they used the beans for brewing, asked for a new one, same thing Bacon swimming on oil, and burnt  Worst part, there are people partying on our floor. Cant sleep"
174,November 2017,"Spacious Rooms, Average food",NA,40,"They have spacious rooms, good for family and friends staycation.   Food was average. Can still be improved.   Wifi signal is not that good, kept getting disconnected during my stay. Opted to use my data instead."
175,November 2017,Spacious Rooms,NA,40,"My friend's wedding was held here. Just one downside, they weren't able to refill the food asap. Some of the guests thought that there’s no more food, but after a while, they have replenished the food trays. But some are already not in the mood to eat again - there were plenty of leftover. Even though I've been here several times, usually for a meeting or office event, it's our first time to check-in to their rooms. It's spacious and cozy with good amenities."
176,May 2018,Horrible Experience,NA,20,- Were always given parking slots by the wall where it was difficult to get in and out - Noone to attend to at valet parking - Empty water bottles were not thrown out - Odd smell in the room - Pipes under the sink were leaking - Decline of the Property from Oakwood to Joy Nostalg managed by Accor - Request for at a 1pm late check out was denied
177,March 2018,So sad.,NA,30,"My family is a regular hotel guest of this hotel - Oakwood at that time. Our recent stay last March 2018 was our first time with Joy Nostalg Accor. (Mind you though we are a regular Accor hote guest). My husband and I were disappointed in our recent stay.   First, reservations were done over the Accor app, no cancellation charge even if cancelled on the day. The following day, I received an email from Joy Nostalg Manila requesting that I confirm the room or that it becomes non-cancellable and this was a week before our check-in. I did not mind that but what concerned me was that the email had a history of emails from other hotel guests. I did notify their reservations office that this shouldn’t happen again.  Second, my husband and I arrived late in the hotel because we had"
178,April 2018,My personal fave,NA,50,"Recently, we have  decided to do our business meeting in Joy Nostalg. As expected, everything was handled efficiently. Two thumbs up for the food, meeting room arrangements and facilities, and all the staff who took care of our needs!  (On a personal note,I  have always enjoyed tremendously the spacious rooms and breakfast and lunch buffets!)"
179,April 2018,Better experience after the 1st,NA,40,"Great location to be. A service apartment that you utilize the washing machine. Check in process could be shorter. There are 2 entrance so be sure you select topaz road. Didn't do the breakfast so I cannot comment. Walkable to SM megamall within 8 min. Coffee bean, 7-11 all nearby. Accor member get points!"
180,April 2018,Spacious Rooms but Mixed Service,NA,30,Stayed for 5 days as part of a Business trip.  The hotel is in the Ortigas business district so for those working in the area the location is good however the hotel itself is in a average street with noisy dusty construction going on nearby and a large car park next door.Lacks street appeal. Upon arrival I struggled to bring my suitcase in whilst the guard just watched me. Was greeted by a somewhat grumpy front desk crew which is something noted in several reviews here. The room itself was well appointed and very spacious and clean although let down by sloppy housekeeping missing coat hangers and laundry bags. Overall it’s a good room however the restaurant and bar area is a contrast. Night time was great. Really friendly and attentive bar staff and nice food. Breakfast however
181,March 2018,Worth it!,NA,50,"Welcoming people.. Stephen of FO was really 👍👍..  Room is huge , our 1bedroom suite was really great! With a fully equiped kitchen where you can cook, huge fridge, coffee maker, stove etc.🍴☕  Shower and bath tub 🛁🛁 which my baby really likes  Pool 🏊🏊 that is warm and  great for kids. Like it better coz its indoor.Shower and locker room is very clean and well maintained.  Hotel is near malls if you want to go shopping.  Very relaxing stay"
182,April 2018,Lunch at nostalgia restaurant,NA,30,"Serving buffet for lunch but it doesn’t look so good. Not worth the buffet. So we had ala carte menu and decided to have lamb chops. Price is very reasonable... a little over ₱1,000. Ordered soup and I was good. The lamb chops are good as well. Not so much to choose from the ala carte menu. Most guests are workers from AUB BANK. WELL It’s because AUB owns the property."
183,March 2018,"Nice and spacious, good location.",NA,40,We enjoyed our stay at Joy Nostalg. We were in the executive one bedroom and there was plenty of space. I especially like the bathroom with the steam shower and the stand alone tub. The kitchen had a washer and enough kitchen stuff to make a decent meal and easily a good breakfast...I only deducted one star because I felt the room could have been a bit cleaner. The staff are great. The location is very convenient. Would recommend the place and would stay here again. Bonus is they are x 4 points now on your accor card.
184,March 2018,Excellent ,NA,50,"If you plan to stay even a single day in Manila, this is where to stay. Very comorftable rooms, very impressive restaurant and cafè and personnel pleasant and careful.  Recommended for business travel and luxury holidays."
185,March 2018,Could have been good,NA,20,"The room was lovely, it had its own mini kitchen, utensils and refrigerator. The toilet flush though was broken and so we called for someone to repair. They had it repaired but it had continued dripping after. The restaurant at the 6th floor has a loungy  feel and the food is overpriced. The waitress gave us a limited choice menu which was a disappointment, and presented us the main menu only when I mentioned that their menu is limited. The waitress told us also that they charge corkage for our child’s food, and I said do they have a kid’s menu, and they don’t. I mentioned that my child has a special diet. They likewise have weird music playing which lead to a weird feeling ambience. There were not much dining choices and so we had no choice but to stay here and eat. "
186,February 2018,Still good...,NA,40,"I have recently travelled to the philippines for  business again and stayed here. (First was 2013)  The rooms are nice and big, everything u need for an extended stay.  The rooms are nice loooking but the workmanship is a little off, but nothing major.  The staff as per the last trip in 2013 are very nice, friendly and are always willing to help, they are probably the biggest reason for a 4/5 rating and the hotels biggest assest.  Location is ideal, a lot around the area to do, plus close to shopping and etc which is was handy for my 2 week stay. "
187,February 2018,Perfect Stay,NA,50,"Nice welcome, attentive reception, great rooms plus perfect location! Reception staff, Ms. Michiko is very commendable as she go extra length to make sure I got right info about where to go and what to do during my stay."
188,January 2018,always a pleasant stay,NA,50,"Oakwood has been our favorite since 2014 when we had our wedding preparations here. Amazing location and beautiful functional rooms and wonderful, helpful and friendly staff. Always our home when we visit Manila"
189,November 2017,"Overall, it was a good first time experience and hoping to stay again.’",NA,40,"I was impressed that upon parking, there is a designated parking slot for each room. It makes it easy for the hotel guest to park without the hassle of having to look for your own parking space, like in other hotels. The room was also very spacious with a LOT of amenities. The bathroom amenities were nice. I liked the soap very much. Cool that there was a TV in the bathroom, and a washing machine in the room. The kitchen was also complete for 2. The staff were accomodating. I had to go back and forth from our room in the 22nd floor to the 15th floor for wedding preparations. The reception staff gave me access to the 15th floor to ease my transfers. Check in and check out were also quick!  We got confused between the hotel elevator and the office elevator. We weren't able to go"
190,January 2018,Brilliant place to stay,NA,50,"I stayed here for 3 weeks whilst on a business trip...not a bad word to say about this place all the staff are friendly and helpful...a big shout out the the lads who work behind the bar Mac, Hope and Veil truly outstanding service from them...I will definitely stay again on my next visit."
191,December 2017,Cozy pet-friendly hotel,NA,40,"We mostly enjoyed our stay in the executive suite. The room was very spacious and clean, with a range of amenities including a microwave, oven and fridge. We did not see a washer or dryer though, despite the hotel website stating it has one. We appreciate that it is a pet-friendly hotel. If you are planning to bring your pet, please be a responsible pet owner and note that you need to pay a pet fee and deposit. Also note that pets are not allowed in other areas of the hotel.  We also availed of the Christmas buffet. Despite the selection being limited, the food was very good. We also appreciated the more intimate atmosphere afforded by the restaurant, compared to other hotel buffets.  Our visit was a bit marred due to the parking. We briefly left the hotel for a few minutes."
192,January 2018,Great place to have a family reunion!,NA,40,We booked a 3 bedroom unit overnight for our family reunion. The family had a blast! We ordered food delivery from nearby restaurants and staff notified us every delivery. Our family enjoyed the spacious rooms. Each room was utilised by different generation. Staff were very accommodating. Over 50 of us filled the rooms without feeling crowded. Sadly most of our family stayed up to midnight only though a few of us stayed overnight. Breakfast next morning was good but choice was limited.
193,December 2017,"Great rooms, good location, small pool",NA,40,"This is my first time to have a staycation in this hotel and I loved that the rooms were spacious for a family of 4. The 1BR unit came with complete kitchen utensils and cooking wares...so we decided to just cook our own breakfast instead of paying for the hotel breakfast buffet.   The pool, well, the kids loved it, but I felt it was too small and there were limited chairs to put your stuff on. The jacuzzi was great as well.  Parking was very limited but they made up for it by reimbursing parking fees if you parked in the lot beside the hotel.  Overall, Joy~Nostalg was great for families with pets (as they allowed pets in their rooms). great stay for us and very convenient as it was very near Galleria mall, Podium and Megamall."
194,January 2018,service sucks,NA,10,"Service sucks here. we have to wait for 45 mins just to be seated for our breakfast. our table was not cleaned, and all their staff are in disarray. ive been staying here for 5 straight years to spend our new years’ eve with my family and this will be our last!!!"
195,December 2017,Best Hotel Amenities but Poor Staff in the Reception,NA,40,"First time to stay in this hotel and I was amazed with its complete amenities. I booked 1 bedroom suite, the room is so huge, clean and comfortable.  Unfortunately most of the staff in the reception area that I have encountered were not fully knowledgeable on the system and rulings of the hotel. There were many instances that they gave me wrong information on my queries and  the computation of my billing  was also miscalculated.  Despite of this experience, I will still come back and enjoy the comfort and luxury of this hotel."
196,December 2017,"Good Location, Clean and Spacious Rooms & Bath",NA,50,"Booked 2N in their 1 bedroom Suite and it was a comfortable stay. It's almost living in a private home with all the basic amenities available such as the Full sized fridge, oven, stove top, dish washer, washing machine, etc. Plus, I did enjoy the steam bath too.   Liked the gym - clean and good equipment & the kids enjoy the indoor pool too.  Location wise, it's just walking distance to shopping malls."
197,November 2017,Home away from home.,NA,50,"Feels like home. Its units are 2 big separate rooms; one for the master suite and bath and the other for its complete kitchen with dining table for 4. Its seating are offers partial view of the remaining landscape thats devoid of tall buildings. Security is tight. Breakfast is also great. It has a gym, indor pool and dry sauna. Its a great hotel to stay because its very close to malls."
198,November 2017,Favorite Staycation Hotel,NA,50,We keep coming back to Joy Nostalg Hotel. It is our favorite staycation hotel because our furbaby is welcome here. Their rooms are luxurious and huge. The bathroom is glorious. I love the bathtub. We will definitely be back!
199,November 2017,My home away from home,NA,50,"I was on the 18th floor this time and I must say I like the light colored theme than the dark ones. The furnitures are still old but not stained. The staff are the same courteous staff as before even under new management. Sadly, Maggie from housekeeping left but Kerry is more than capable. I’d like to thank Jake for taking care of us during my stay. Please serve Pinoy breakfast, balikbayans like me will appreciate them."
200,November 2017,All the essentials ,NA,50,"Located right across the street from Asian Development Bank.  Unit has frig, microwave, stove, washer, and all other essentials.  Very new and nicely done.  It is also Services daily.  Restaurant is reasonably priced and has good food.  Highly recommended. "
201,November 2017,Very Nice Hotel but Poor After Service,NA,30,"Upon arriving, none of the bell boys bothered to approach our car and open the door or offer help. They were literally just staring at us and did not move from their spot. Very very unhelpful.  I booked a room with 2 single beds but upon entering our room, we were given one King bed. We immediately called the reception and told them we were given the wrong room and they said they had none available with 2 single beds. They were all booked. They should have told us from the very beginning...  The room was actually nice and cozy. Pretty spacious for a studio. But when we were about to shower, the steamer was not functioning properly. We called and they had someone from engineering check. We were told that it was working and we just had to wait for 30mins. We waited and it still"
202,November 2017,"Great hotel, bad hospitality.",NA,20,"Usually when I stay in a hotel you expect hospitality. Sadly this hotel does not. Hotel amenities are top notch and yet the staff, most notably the guest services are not up to par. Multiple incidents such as lighting fixtures and bath features were flawed. The worst part of the experience was when we originally requested two bed and were told there were no available rooms left. When our current room started to show flaws and we started complaining, then only did the guest services offered us a new room. We had to wait 2hours which delayed our showers and dinner just to be moved to another room. The next morning was even worse, the laundry girl door-belled multiple times in the morning to ask if we had laundry. We also woke up with a room smelling like paint coming from the"
203,August 2017,Lovely rooms and good staff,NA,40,"I really like its suites ... they are big with fully furnished kitchen, living room and bed room. Bathroom have a private steam room as shower room + tub. Staff is also v helpful, nice bar with smoking area and good breakfast. My only issue here is most taxi drivers don’t know this place and it has two entrances one on hotel side and one on office side ... all of his creates some confusion at times. So I then usually use hotel transport only for pick up and drops which works out well."
204,October 2017,A scape from the rain,NA,40,Positive points  ~ very accommodating and proactive staff ~ Nice executive suite  - strict on dress code on the pool ~ utensils are perfect fit for the kitchen   Negative points  ~ breakfast is not automatically included even if it's a one day accommodation  ~ access point of ingress/egress only one during Sunday's 
205,October 2017,Terrible service ,NA,10,"Given that it is a 5 star hotel I expect the service to be good if not excellent. However this morning I ordered a private dinning and it took 50mins to arrive. In between I have to call private dinning twice to check on my order. This is so frustrating given that I am rushing for my meeting at 8am. In the end, I have to attend my meeting without breakfast. It is the most important meal for me of the day. This is the first time and last time I will be staying in this hotel. Room 1507 is good. Just that the service is very disappointing. "
206,October 2017,A very comfortable business hotel,NA,40,"For $160 a night this is one of the nicest rooms I’ve stayed in for some time. Mind you the only reason you would stay in this part of town is to work with the Asian Development Bank (which is across the rode) or to go shopping in one of the many malls nearby.   The executive business room has a self-contained kitchen, settee area with table, bed and in a nook on the side for work.   There is a floor to ceiling window across to the ADB.  Service has been attentive but I through them when I asked whether I could walk somewhere. They weren’t keen on it and definitely didn’t want me to take the train.   The area seems pretty safe. There is a large supermarket (Robinsons) about a block or two away. "
207,October 2016,Luxurious Hotel and it's Pet Friendly,NA,50,"It's hard to find a hotel in Manila that welcomes our pets. That's the reality. We love Oakwood Premier Joy not only for the luxurious rooms (and bathroom!), but most specially for allowing our furbabies to stay as well."
208,June 2017,Our go-to family hotel,NA,50,"We always have Oakwood as our ""top pick"" or even default option whenever we celebrate Christmas and birthdays. Aside from service is great, facilities are awesome too. Limited buffet selection though but there are malls and restaurants within the area so you can easily cross the street if you are looking for options. Our favorite staff is Dion. We were surprised of how he remember names and faces. He actually remembered us on our second stay (and that was months apart) from then on we always look for him whenever we stay there. Cheers! "
209,August 2017,Great place to live ,NA,50,"I visit Manila every 3 months and decided to try Oakwood. I lived here a few years & used their Studio apartment which was quite impressive. This time i stayed in the Suite. Wow. Very spacious service apartment with all you need at your fingertips. The staff is very courteous, always smiling and going out of their way to help. Their food is good but not the best. Their Lamb steak was too good. Breakfast spread is quite good too. The swimming pool is enclosed, heater and a quite long, with underwater music. So if you wanna relax, just swim uninterrupted. I didn't use the gym but it looked quite spacious and modern too. Please note that there are 2 entries to the hotel and if you book an uber or a grab, it never comes to the hotel lobby. It comes the opposite lobby which I"
210,August 2017,Spacious suite!,NA,50,Their suite is amazing! Spacious for family! This has always been my family's favorite place to stay when we need to be in the area to attend events. The staff are always helpful and welcoming. In room dining was above average. Their pizza in on top of our list.
211,August 2017,Good Business apartment,NA,30,"It's a nice, clean and good hotel in the middle of the business district. The food was good and rooms were fine. It's a good hotel for those coming on business trips.  It's a bit difficult to get here during peak hours with very very bad traffic especially if coming from airport."
212,June 2017,Staycation at the Heart of Metro,NA,50,The place was freakin' spacious! We loved the cleanliness of the place and the service from their staff was also impeccable. All our requests were given at the quickest time possible and their kitchen area was the best kitchen I cooked in so far!
213,July 2017,My Oakwood wedding,NA,50,I was pleased with the effort the staff put forward to make our wedding an event we will always treasure. If you are looking for a unique experience I would highly recommend the Oakwood. Thank you Malou and Bessie.
214,June 2017,Excellent stay. Value for money,NA,50,Great service. The staff was extra polite and helpful. Be it at front desk ms rosa or at swimming pool. My recommendations is to try to get the room on higher floor facing adb avenue. It's quite good.
215,April 2017,Private Time with Family,NA,50,"We decided to spend holy week vacation in Oakwood. We are very satisfied with the way they handled so many guest during our stay. Even if  there's long line, we just waited for few minutes and the check-in and check-out time is so fast. All the front desk ladies are very accommodating and you will feel the warm welcome from them.   The room was great and the sunset view from our room was just fantasic. We were  able to cook   our own  food since during our stay most of the establishments are close. The breakfast was not that great, few food choices and the coffee is not hot. LOL.   "
216,July 2017,Home away from home,NA,40,"Stayed at the Oakwood again over the weekend and it never fails to disappoint from the friendly staff, to the fine quality of accommodations and food. Have stayed here in excess of 20 times now and have never had a bad experience. Whether it for a place to get away for a overnight or a long stay when away on business the Oakwood hits the marks on all fronts. Has a top quality restaurant, fitness center and pool area, while in the heart of Ortigas Center shopping district. I would challenge you to find another apt-hotel that offers the room sizes and amenities for the same price as the Oakwood offers. You should not be disappointed......"
217,June 2017,A Class Accomodation,NA,50,"I was there for a 2 days conference. I thought it's gonna be boring, but once I unlock the hotel room door and find the suite was incredibly comfy, I started to like it. The room is big, with a living room, equipped with personal bar, big bathroom where you can dip your tired body and watching TV all together.  The food is also super yumm..."
218,June 2017,Convenient and cimfortable,NA,40,"I stayed in a 1-bedroom suite when I attended a meeting at the Asian Development Bank which was just across the road . The location was also close to several shopping malls including the MegaMall with shops , restaurants, food court and supermarket. My suite was very comfortably furnished and also had a well equipped kitchenette. Service was  friendly and efficient. The only disadvantage is the congested traffic in that area. "
219,May 2017,Joy at Oakwood hotel,NA,50,"Beautiful hotel, i like the bed it is so comfortable. The room is huge and i feel very relaxed during our stay. The kids enjoyed swimming and my wife enjoyed cooking in the kitchen. I will definitely come back to this hotel, because everything is in this hotel."
220,June 2017,Very nice apartment hotel with full service,NA,40,"Very nicely located hotel with full kitchen, washing machine and dryer.   Friendly staff and good service for shorter or longer stays.   Plus for nice gym and swimming pool. The breakfast is also very good."
221,June 2017,Official travel of ADB ,NA,40,I have been staying at this hotel for so many times in the last few years. It's just opposite of ADB HQ.  Staying at hotel is just awesome. It has big room with all modern amenities. Services are good and up to the mark. A few top shopping malls with good movie theatre are around the hotel. Good food courts and coffee shops are there too. Enough places to spend for leisure to me. 
222,July 2016,6th stay rooms not like before,NA,30,"Rooms are no longer the same like we first stayed in 2013-2015. They had gotten old, the carpet etc. Not as nice anymore. Kitchen items are now limited. However it is still a decent serviced residence and location is still great. Clean and spacious"
223,April 2017,Could improve,NA,30,"Nice hotel, nice food, great location but service could still improve .. Loved their indoor pool! I think you just need to improve the quality of service . Requested for a laundry bag and it took almost half an hour but its not a big issue though I understand busy situations  Still going back to this apartment  Thanks to you guys"
224,May 2017,Mother's Day Retreat,NA,50,"Spent Mother's Day with my mom and sister [Mom to 5 kids!] at Oakwood Joy and it was great :) check in was good [could be faster, though] but the room was amazing, as always. This has become my fave retreat away from home.   Will definitely be back."
225,March 2017,15 mins walk to SM mall,NA,40,"Stayed for a weekend , was attending a wedding for a friend. Friendly service at reception , hotel was actually more like service apartment concept . we got a room , it had a small kitchen area , with all the cooking utensils, great for people who wanted to cook. No complaints on overall stay but fittings in rooms were a bit worn out. Super comfortable King size bed. Great location , you can walk to some fast food restaurants 10 mins away. Close enough to SM mall to walk."
226,May 2017,Could be better but ok.,NA,40,"We stayed for 4 nights. Arrived late from a 9 hours flight. Exactly arrived at the hotel at 12:30 early in the morning.   I've asked for the reception if she can upgrade us since we are a repeat customer but said she will try. Talked to the approving officer at the back then came back told us apologizing she can't...  told her the case why but our request was rejected. Anyway, moving on, as we are very hungry from a very long flight wanted to order food but told us restaurant is already closed... :(  Food, was ok. Only a few selection...   Our room cleaner Gon was very accomodating. And did his job well. He see to it our room are clean and well kept. Despite his tiring tasks he maintain and very consistent with his very cheerful disposition. The hotel is lucky to have him.  "
227,May 2017,Not as good as previous visit,NA,40,"The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful at Oakwood, always. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, have everything you need, and breakfast is good.  The location is great if you need to be in Ortigas.  I even walked to MRT in about 10 min. I also borrowed a good movie on DVD one night. Room service is good but the food quality is variable depending on what you order (i was not impressed by the pizza, for example). I have stayed here before and there were drawbacks this time. My room had a musty smell.  This was annoying upon entering the room, though I mainly experienced it in the foyer/kitchen area. The other serious drawback was that I was on a low floor and there was a construction site immediately across the street -- operating equipment all night long. This was a"
228,November 2016,Home away from home and Friends became family!,NA,50,"The top experience I had at any hotel world wide. A True Professional staff. Clean rooms, wonderful facilities and a southern hospitality feel. Excellent long term guest benefits. The Oakwood team made my 5 months away from my home very enjoyable. The Food and Beverage team took care of me every night with cold strong drinks and excellent food (Thanks KB and team). The daily warm welcome of the reception team made my come and going very welcomed  and secure (Jake and team). The wonderful members of the Sales and Marketing team (Lorie and team) completed my trip with excellent friendship and professional treatment. I will never forget my stay at Oakwood Manila and I look forward to another trip there one day. Finally I will enjoy the continued life time friendship with the entire"
229,April 2017,A great service apartment in the heart of Ortigas!,NA,50,"Every corner of this hotel is definitely worth great feedback. Oakwood Premier exudes class, elegance and grace.   Entering the hotel was such a bliss as you could already feel that it is going to be a great stay. The staff were so warm and the interiors were superb. The one bedroom comes with a generous space that I could even run around.  My favorite part is definitely the detached bath tub. I soon learned that I can also transform the toilet into my own steam room. If I had enough time, I would have tried the kitchen. The kitchen had an oven and a dishwasher!   The cherry on top of the staycation is the Trivia Night at the Oakroom Lounge Bar. It was such a fun experience to hang around and be in a friendly competition with the staff and other guests. We won beers for winning"
230,April 2017,"Friendly housekeepers, happy stay",NA,50,Imagine the relaxation of the staycation if the room attendants are very hospitable and friendly? If you are to go here I suggest you request higher floors especially 17th floor. i just forgot the name of the room attendant.
231,April 2017,Excellent Service,NA,50,Very good service and courteous staff!Nice ambience and complete room facility!Will be going back definitely! Had a very relaxing and comfortable stay. Value for money hotel within Ortigas business district!
232,April 2017,Price & Service Mismatch,NA,10,"Better to choose other hotels within Ortigas. When it's pricey, it doesn't mean that the overall service is good. -walls not soundproof, maybe made of light materials. We're being heard even if we're just talking using our normal voice. Thus better not to talk and just sleep.  -elevators/key cards not working well. I asked for replacement and the process was too slow. -poor customer service, not courteous front desk officers -drainage at the shower area not working well  Won't be choosing and recommending this hotel to others."
233,March 2017,Disappointed!!!,NA,20,"Parking was an issue. Next, when we checked in the front desk was fast however when we entered our room it smelled like smoke. I called the frontdesk inmediately and she said it wasna smoking a floor. Seriously, is that the hotel protocol, she even saw me with my kids. I said i want to be transfered , she said its imposible due to high occupancy rate. She said she will just give me an ionizer. I said its okay just prepare an ambulance anytime starting today. My 2 kids have asthma. As ive said in all my reviews , i gauge the hotel room cleanliness based on the asthma attack of my kids. Anyway she immediately told us to go down.. when we went down, i saw my colleagues there falling in line to check in. To my surprise all of them who came late were given non smoking room and a"
234,January 2017,Staycation,NA,40,"This hotel has a complete amenities that you didn't notice that you left home from their kitchenette, laundry area, dining room, living room it was so comfy to stay here.  Aside from the shower area, they still have more room for the bathtub and a tv monitor.  Imagine the relaxation of the staycation? That is why my kids considered staying here than going out of town...they said this is relaxation!  Please be reminded for those who have asthma that they welcome pets in their rooms.  But the room is still spotless! Check-in and check-out took us 30-45mins due to the occasion.  Beyond that we were taken good care of."
235,April 2016,Somehow frustrating,NA,30,This is a very long overdue review but nevertheless its worth sharing to readers.  Rooms is well appointed though you will notice some wear and tear like chipped edges on baseboard skirts and cornice.  I love the toilet and bath with a small tv monitor.  My frustration came in when I complained about the bagging noise at around 1130PM.  They said they will look into it and give feedback.  after 20 minutes the noise was stopped so its a very good action they made.  However at past 130AM when I fell asleep already a call came in just to say that they did not find any noise activities near my room.  It's a wee hour and they have the courage to call up. Very wrong judgement call.  The following day I looked for a DM and shared my concerned.  She apologized somehow but I did not feel
236,March 2017,A day is not enough.,NA,40,"It was an overnight stay for a product pre-launch. We arrived at the hotel at around 3pm. The check-in was speedy and our group was delighted because we were still accommodated for lunch at their buffet. Sad that i had a bad headache so i opted to stay in my room on the 18th floor. I was impressed with the facilities, the way they tucked the different sections of the room like the laundry area, the ironing stuff, the safety box, in such a way that it still had enough room for my belongings. The area is magnified by a generous number of multipurpose mirrors/cabinets. I love the way they separated the mini kitchen from the bed through a comfy sofa and a work table. The only thing i'd like to emphasize is that if you just can hop out of your room and look for a nearby place to"
237,March 2017,"Nice room for families, but parking was problematic",NA,20,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite recently. The room was aptly for a family staycation. The room's foyer was spacious enough to serve as our Playstation game section. My biggest peeve about this place though was the parking problem we experience on our second night. We had dinner outside and when we returned to the hotel to park, we were informed by the guard that ther was no more parking. He even said that there was no more space via valet. His recommendation was that we park elsewhere, at an open air parking lot beside the hotel. This really destroyed the good experience we were having prior. I went to the front desk and talked to someone handling the cars (I have to note that they were fairly flustered; likely due to the influx of people for a wedding the next day). In the end,"
238,March 2017,Perfect for family Staycation,NA,50,"We stayed at Oakwood for 4 days and 3 nights and they gave us 2 different 1-Bedroom Executive Suite (for me and my husband while the other one is for my sister, brother, sister-in-law and my niece) with a very lovely and spacious bathroom with its own steam shower! My niece enjoyed the bathtub while watching her cartoons, Yes, there's a tv inside the bathroom! how cool is that? I enjoyed having the dishwasher and washing machine inside the room especially we have lots of dirty clothes from our Cebu, Bohol nd Palawan trip. Yey! Less work for me!  I think this location is more for business travelers but it has a homely vibe that families can also enjoy! The breakfast buffet at the restaurant has a lot of great options. We also tried their restaurant which is The Nostalgia"
239,March 2017,Awesome,NA,50,"I have all praises for this place. At first I thought it was only physically beautiful , comfortable and functional . But what I really appreciated was the service and the extra mile their staff gave us . Then came the test of the extra mile . After we checked out ,  I actually left something in the room ,. I called them to ask about it and when they found it they went all out to look for me and tell me indeed l left something.. How awesome is that? How many institutions would bother about you after you have paid and left?  Go book yourselves there to confirm my review."
240,March 2017,Dont understand the fuss about this place for multiple reasons,NA,30,"Ok--so first I can say I wouldn't voluntarily go to this section of Manila if you paid me. Why do you want to stay and be forced into one shopping mall after another to eat at a restaurant and find basic snacks? My idea of hell. Unfortunately its the turf of Asian Development Bank and other corporate actors and malls are just too popular in this town full stop (think Emirates). As noted, all units here have a kitchen (requiring you to go to mall based grocery stores if you choose to use them); rooms 'junior suites' are not large, you can get a nice view on upper floors (18 &up) and the aircon made both my friend and me miserable (low isn't low and again its direct). Breakfast is overpriced if not included in your rate and the bar and restaurant on 6th floor were justifiably dead"
241,March 2016,fantastic place!!!!,NA,50,"Compare to other hotels here, Oakwood is excellent. You can enjoy big and clean room, and you also can enjoy your stay here. They have good gym and swimming pool. Breakfast is good enough than any other hotel nearby. The best thing is that if you have some business with ADB, Oakwood is just in opposite. It is convenient when some forum holding in ADB. BTW, you can get good price if you stay here for attending ADB's any forum or activities."
242,January 2017,A night to remember....before the wedding,NA,50,"We occupied a one-bedroom suite.  It was clean, spacious, the kitchen was great.  The toilet and bathroom were clean and had enough towels and toiletries.  Didn't have time to use the bathtub but my son really enjoyed it because there was tv inside.  The front desk personnel was very warmth and helpful as well as the porters and bellboys.  We really had a great time and made the following day, stress-free, and made us ready for our son's wedding in a church nearby.  The free buffet breakfast was sumptuous although there wasn't enough food variation, but the friendly and helpful staff, however, more than compensated  Please take note that if you want a king size or twin bed, request for it when you make your reservation.  I highly recommend this hotel for families of the groom"
243,February 2017,Terrible service,NA,10,"I've been in hotels in Europe with pompous staff but this one is the worst that I've seen.  The front desk officer that I had to interact with seems to be irritated whenever you have a concern.  Checking out, that same person didn't even bother to warn me about the construction that was happening at the opposite lobby where the elevators are going to the basement parking. I had my 5 year old son with me and we had to hold our breath as we waited for the elevator for there was a thick cloud of dust covering the area.  We can't even go back to the other lobby as we've surrendered had the key card upon checking out.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE"
244,March 2016,Stay-cation beyond what you deserve! :-),NA,50,"So, my friend and I were invited to stay for night in Nostalg and it was AMAZING. The room itself is overwhelming. We stayed in a two-bedroom executive suite. It was amazing! You wouldn't want to leave your room. Seriously!  You have everything your need. • Bathtub with TV infront of you as you relax. • Big rooms. • Big guest area.   Oh Boy!! The amenities are awesome. Bar, Gym, Indoor Pool and Jacuzzi ... You'd love it!!  The food? Classy and Satisfying!!   Service and Security? 2 Thumbs UP!!  Enjoy!!"
245,December 2016,The most charming suite room ever!,NA,50,"All rooms are simply elegant and charming :) The furnitures and appliances are top rated and I adore (super adore) their bathtub! My daughter enjoyed the indoor pool even though it was a bit small, it was still good because of the warm water."
246,February 2017,lovely staycation but unpleasant breakfast,NA,20,"i love the interio of my room. very chic and modern. i was amazed when the shower room has a steam. no complimentary welcome such as fruit platter. the pool was warm and clean.  i had a breakfast at nostalgia dining lounge 6/F. i was not feeling well. limited array of food. and the waiter was so rude. i was asking for a glass of water and he just pointed the location of the water. it's like he was asking me to get it from there. very unprofessional. may be if you can compensate me for the bad experience, i will come back in this hotel."
247,February 2017,Great place to stay at,NA,40,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 days and 2 nights (February 12-14). I was really impressed with the room, it looked like a small condomimium unit. The room's kitchen was fully furnished and we had fun cooking our dinner. The shower room in the bathroom also allows you to have steam while showering. The hotel was also near malls like Megamall and Podium so you can visit the malls when you feel bored.   The breakfast buffet was okay, however we felt that the options were very limited. The restaurant looked elegant. The pool was also beautiful and the staff were really accommodating and nice.   The only cons we could think about the hotel were: -The walls are thin: You can hear the people talking outside of the room very clearly. You can also hear the opening and closing of the doors"
248,January 2017,AMAZING,NA,50,"I absolutely loved my stay here at the Oakwood. I was there for two weeks and there wasn't a single thing I could fault. I stayed in a one bedroom suit kitchen was great, very spacious living and bedroom, and the bathroom was amazing too; great size shower free standing bath with a tv. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Hotel is in a great location too! If I ever go back to Manila I would stay here again. Thanks for making my time in The Phillipines amazing. "
249,July 2016,Lovely accomodation with everything you need,NA,50,"I stayed at the Oakwood on a business trip for 6 weeks.  The 2 bedroom suite had everything I needed - washer/dryer, fully equipped kitchen, comfy lounge area and roomy bedroom.  The staff were all excellent and were at hand whenever anything was needed.   The only downside I experienced was a couple of weekends some rooms were booked out for a night at a time for large groups of people holding parties, which made for noisy neighbours and disrupted sleep, especially when you wanted a weekend sleep in after a busy week at work.   There was also a construction site across the road that was noisy all night long.  You can always ask to be moved to the other side of the building away from the building site."
250,December 2016,Literally Home Away from Home,NA,50,"Firstly, the title of the review was the first words that I came to my mind too after reading paupau1881's review title.   If I needed a place to stay long term, this would definitely be one of the shortlisted choices immediately.   In the fully equipped kitchen, microwave, oven, fridge, washing machine, induction cooker, kettle, coffee maker.Literally everything you need for to making a stay more convenient.   Moving on to the living room, yet another spacious set up, dining table for 4, side table, sofa and chairs are also homely and welcoming. Especially the sofas, some of the softest you can melt into, though the fastidious might be concerned about how to keep the cushion and suede clean between guests, but I digress.   The bed room, again, set up for 2, easily can"
251,January 2017,Disappointing! ,NA,10,"Only hotel i've ever stayed in where my son was not allowed to swim before check-in time!!! I told them im not asking to check in to the room, just for 1 kid to use the pool and the oakwood person still said no. I asked to speak to the manager and he said he was busy and would just call me back. 5 days later and still no call. Awful customer service for a $120 a night hotel. I wouldve cancelled my booking if it wasnt nonrefundable"
252,January 2017,Home away from home,NA,50,Me and my partner had our staycation at Oakwood Premier Joy for 2 nights. We stayed in a 1-bedroom suite. The suite is spacious and well maintained. All the staff are very courteous and friendly.   Location is very good as it is accessible to malls and to my dentist's clinic. 😊  We were not able to use the pool because of some renovation though. 😞  Will definitely go back! 😊  
253,January 2017,Good location and spacious room,NA,40,"I was in Manila for an ADB meeting, and the location was perfect for that. The room was quite spacious and had a kitchenette, a large fridge and a washing machine. The separate writing desk was quite useful for my work.  The view was nothing great showing construction activity.  Internet was quite good. The breakfast included in the price  had variety though choice was not great.   Both the Robinson shopping complex and the Mega Mall are within walking distance. The Asian Development Bank is across the street.  The staff were friendly and always prepared to help. For the price I paid, it is very good value. I am however, not sure whether some packages come without breakfast or internet."
254,January 2017,Oakwood stay,NA,40,"We stayed here for my husband's birthday last January 2016. The location is good because it is very near my office and my daughter's school, and of course the major malls of Ortigas Center. The hotel is classy although it also has several floors that are offices, so basically the lobby is divided into two, for hotel guests and the other for office workers. The food is a bit pricey but just right since quality is good. The room is modern and comfortable, but to our dismay, there seemed to be a problem with their drainage system.. we got surprised when all of a sudden, water from the bathroom was everywhere and even reached the bedroom and the sala area. We did enjoy our stay, except for that incident."
255,January 2017,Love the Space!,NA,50,"We decided to return to the Oakwood after having stayed here a couple of times over a two year period.  No disappointments here except for a couple of minor issues.  The location is a convenient walk to The Podium and Robinson Mall.  With a stretch, you can also walk to Mega Mall.  Taxi drivers are more courteous now with Uber operating here.  Nice to have the choice. Our room included the breakfast buffet in the Nostalgia Restaurant.  They do change up the food items a little each day for limited variety.  WIFI in the room is strong but weak in the lobby area. Unfortunately, the swimming pool was under maintenance so we were not able to avail ourselves of its use.We started off in a studio but found it too cramped.  So we upgraded to a one bedroom which is hugely roomier with"
256,January 2017,Very Disappointing. Will NOT recommend!,NA,20,"I am very disappointed by the room at Oakwood. This is my experience with the room:  1, It was dirty - someone else's hair and bits of trash scattered everywhere, especially the bathroom.  A large hairball was fell out of the supposedly clean, folded bathmat.  2. It was bad quality - the toilet bowl clogged REPEATEDLY (twice already in 12 hours, and I have one more night here!!!!).    3. It was unpleasant -  POOR SHOWER DRAINAGE. Water accumulated till 1.5 cm at my feet during shower and took 20 minutes to drain completely!  4. It was appalling - the pillows and bedsheets SMELLED BAD, probably of previous guest(s). You will not find freshly laundered linen here!  5. It was FREEZING. The thermostat does NOT work."
257,September 2016,Good proximity to ADB.  Good hotel.  Expensive food. Whisky Bar has a GREAT range!,NA,40,"Was there for several days of meetings with the Asia Development Bank which is a walk straight across the road.  So proximity to ADB was excellent for me. Rooms were nice.  The whisky bar is excellent with a brilliant range of whisky from across the world. Food and drinks in the hotel were expensive so definitely worth taking a walk to find restaurants nearby, or in the nearby malls.  We found a good Japanese in a nearby mall."
258,December 2016,Extraordinary,NA,50,"Such large rooms!  We booked 4 rooms for 2 nights for 4 families getting together.  It was a perfect place for such a large gathering.  The rooms were large enough to accomodate everyone in 1 room for dinner or just for lying around.  You can retreat to the privacy of your bedroom if you have guests in your room since the bedroom can be closed off.  It has everything needed in a serviced apartment.  A bathtub (with tv), shower with steam, and his and hers wash basin, completes the creature conforts.  Perfect for our purpose. Wow!"
259,February 2016,Excellent hotel,NA,50,"Very spacious rooms, with all kitchen utencil, excellent breakfast and good range. Staff is attentive. Overall, I am always excited in staying in this hotel. You will find shopping malls in walking distance."
260,December 2016,#2 Hotel in the Area but #1 if You Don't Need All The Extras,NA,50,"Stayed here for a night before Christmas, we got the studio room in a smoking floor (Yes, they have one) The room was spacious given that it was one of their smaller rooms, it had a big and comfy bed, A sitting area with a sofa, a fully functioning kitchen, walk in closet and even a study area by the washer and drier. The bathroom is pretty big too and the shower area doubles as a steam sauna.   This is a place you can definitely stay for long periods, the location is great (walking distance to the surrounding malls, a convenience store across the street from the rear entrance) and a very homey feel to the room.  The breakfast that it came with was decent, the regular smorgasbord breakfast selections, nothing to really rave about but you can't not find something to eat. The"
261,January 2017,Quality time with the family plus holidays.,NA,50,"Me and my wife visit Manila to stay with my son and daughter in low. City looking good, multi storages buildings. This city looks made of concrete. Sky high buildings. Worst things are here is traffic. I have visited many cities before but traffic I have seen or experience anywhere else. Oak wood hotel is about five star hotel. Good hotel all round. Happy to be here."
262,January 2017,Disappointing service,NA,30,"Although we encountered a few kinks in our room, like broken door locks (both main and room) & trash bin and slow internet connection, we still loved it as it was very spacious, clean, with a functional kitchen, a sauna and bathtub with tv. Gym is great. Breakfast, ok.  What we didn't like were the services:   1. Housekeeping. The phone just kept on ringing and when it went through, took about 15 minutes or longer for them to deliver the things requested;  2. Although kitchen is functional, everything comes with a price though they should be included in a kitchen, like some detergent, can opener or even an additional plate;  3. And this last one was what really got on my nerve, if not for Christmas season, I'd give a lengthy lecture to the staff of this service apartment."
263,March 2016,Don't go if you have food allergies!,NA,30,Lower floors are spacious and generous; however extremely noisy!  So beware!  Also the vents are connected.  Was not happy to wake up to fish smell at breakfast from the next unit.  I was here on business.  I also had an allergic reaction from breakfast buffet.  How seafood can be mixed in scrambled eggs?  There bar had strong cigar smoke that emanated into main dining area gave me a headache.  Only selected this accommodation do to proximity to office location.  My colleagues enjoyed it though. 
264,December 2016,Okay,NA,40,My stay experience was very nice. Staffs are very nice to us when we stayed here. But i must say that the quality of the amenities is just okay. I dont know why. Its just not a five star thing for me.
265,December 2016,staycation,NA,50,"My family and I decided to have our yearly staycation here in Oakwood. We had a great stay in our suite and it is very comfortable and the have very nice amenities. I am just wondering why they don't have bubble bath soap ready since the hotel has a bath tub, it's the only thing lacking in a perfect bathroom, and by the way please check regularly the handshowers in the bathtub area, it's not functioning well. While waiting on the lobby, I observed that some of the staff are courteous and they are not friendly and approachable, it seems like some of them are being picky on whom hotel guests they want to accommodate. I may say that this is a good place to relax but not so good customer service."
266,December 2016,"Ok, but not premier ...",NA,30,"Spent 2 weeks here in a 1-bedroom suite. Meets all the basics for a relatively expensive serviced apt complex. But ""premier"" would require a bit more work.  Building is nice, everything works, staff are pleasant. Dual purpose office building so you compete with workers in the lobby in the morning, but this is not disruptive. Don't rely on Oakwood for transportation - our confirmed car failed to pick us up at the airport. Front desk and concierge are hopeless at procuring a cab. Download Uber before you arrive and make your own arrangements.  Clean, well furnished, and well staffed but with significant areas for improvement. Big issue is wi-fi - open system with no password required and a big warning that it is not secure. If you need secure wi-fi or are worried about your wi-fi"
267,December 2016,Customer service,NA,50,"My wife and I have stayed at various hotels in Manila however The Oakwood Premier is by far the best for various reasons. First. We are present in a ""Studio Apartment"". The apartment is FULLY serviced and that covers everything down to shampoo, conditioner and even fresh ground coffee for the coffee maker, and these items are complimentary EVERY DAY!!! As for the apartment, it has the usual but what both my wife & I REALLY appreciate is the ""State of the Art"" kitchen with FULL size refrigerator (NOT Bar Fridge), Oven, Convection Microwave, plus all necessities ... Pots & pans and the coffee maker ... Time for a coffee!!! Next. Most hotels charge ""an arm and a leg"" for laundry services ... No need to pay that here as the apartment is supplied with a NEW Samsung washer/dryer."
268,December 2016,"Nice place, but a few flaws",NA,30,"We stayed for four nights in mid-December - two adults and two children. Overall we had a positive stay: the room was mostly really nice, the view was terrific, the breakfast buffet was great, and the staff were friendly and helpful. But there were three main downsides to our visit. One, we had four people staying in our room (which we had clearly advised prior to check-in), but the room was really only set up for two people. Things like only being provided with one bowl, three plates, two knives, two towels, etc (not to mention no dishwashing powder or liquid, no sponge or cloth, etc). Two, we booked this hotel partly because we wanted a laundry, but the dryer didn't work well at all (clothes were still really wet after the full cycle finished), so we had to put wet clothes all"
269,November 2016,Awesome hotel !!,NA,50,"One of the best hotel I have ever stayed accross the world ! Nice location, just opposite of ADB Head Quarter, very close to big shopping malls, restaurants etc. Quite spacious suite room. Big bed room with quite big bathroom with tub, shower closer, tv...Equally big living room with most modern kitchenette. Breakfast room was another big attraction to me, it was nicely decorated. Food quality excellent as well. Got special price through ADB. Only negative I found that staffs are not friendly enough which no way match with the quality of this hotel."
270,September 2016,Luxurious stay,NA,50,"We stayed for 1 night to celebrate my niece's birthday. The suite was spacious and didn't feel boxed in like a normal hotel room. Furnishings were quite elegant, bedroom was massive and bathroom had a tub and a TV (which got my boys' vote). We didn't get to try any room service as it was walking distance from Podium and Megamall (which was the main reason we chose this hotel). The room came with free parking. Pool area is great for lap swimming as well as for kids. Staff at the pool/gym area need a bit of training as we repeatedly asked for the spa to be turned on and he never did, We would stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Ortigas area."
271,December 2016,"Spacious apartments, quite a few glitches",NA,30,"We stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment to celebrate our daughter's birthday. The apartment was very spacious, bathrooms were very nice with good amenities and the living, dining & kitchen area was very nice. The kitchen was complete. But you need to pay for detergent for the dishwasher. They did not provide kitchen towels, dishwashing soap & sponge. It was also disappointing to find out that you have to pay for a bucket of ice and pick it up yourself at the restaurant. Other hotels always provide this for free.  Our check in time was supposed to be at 3:00 PM but the room was not ready until 3:30. We had to wait in the very small lobby for our room to be ready. When we got to the apartment, there was a really bad smell. I had to call for them to check it out and do something about"
272,November 2016,Great Staycation,NA,40,"+ Spacious 1 bedroom + Great facilities like living in an apartment + Perfect bathroom with tub and stream in-room system + Pool is clean with temperatures control  - Even it's located in Ortigas, surrounds with malls, but if you have to get into Makati or BGC, it's too far and not convenience."
273,October 2016,Not as perfect as my first stay,NA,40,"I still enjoyed my stay in their one-bedroom suite, couldn't ask for more.  Had all i needed.  Noticed some fixtures, appliances and bathroom fixtures showed signs of wear but they were all still good.  My only frustration was during the check-in.  We waited for more than 45 minutes, so did most of the guests who arrived together with us.    Breakfast at Nostalgia Restaurant was superb.  Great food, nice set-up.  I still highly recommend this establishment despite their minor hiccup during the check-in."
274,March 2016,Superb!,NA,40,"If you are looking for good service and really clean sheets to sleep on, this is the place to be.  I love that its like a home away from home where you can enjoy freshly cooked food within your room.  The hotel offers a quiet and quaint contemporary feel.  Highly recommended for those who want to really enjoy their home away from home.  Must stay!"
275,March 2016,Costly for a serviced apartment,NA,30,"I usually book hotels around Makati but had events within Ortigas that we had to choose a hotel within the area. I always prefer serviced residence type of hotel because we're allowed to cook and still feel like you're at the comfort of your own home. Discovery Prime was top of mind but its in Makati. Oakwood, by description was perfect.   However, they'll charge for anything extra you ask of them. I'm used to requesting for additional plates, utensils, the likes. (max 2 or 3) in other hotels for FREE. Oakwood will charge you per piece. Staff isn't friendly. Slow response (even if you're paying for it) when you call for room service/housekeeping. I plan to go back next year and hoping to see some improvement."
276,October 2016,It just keeps on getting better and better.,NA,50,"The staff are prompt and courteous, the place is meticulously clean, and we just love the complete cooking and washing setup that comes in every room (we've booked their one bedroom deluxe and two bedroom executive).  Oakwood is the best so far (when it comes to amenities, services, and cost), compared to other popular accommodations within the area that I have experienced."
277,December 2015,Good stay in the heart of Pasig City business center,NA,50,"A good hotel cum service apartment. The studio rooms are split into a kitchen, a lounge and the bedroom. The rooms are equipped with microwave, washing machine and if i remember correctly an induction cook top. The rooms are pretty neat with cozy feel to it. The hotel serves some good food - loved their pan asian breakfast spread that had a it of local delicacies, Chinese, South-east Asian and Indian dishes. More often than not, I dined at the hotel's restaurant which serves amazing beef burger with fries. The place is aptly located in thebusy Ortigas business area. There are lots of dining options around this hotel - personally tried Congo Grill, Toby's Estate and Star Bucks."
278,September 2016,"Simple, efficient with all the quality you need",NA,50,"From the first greeting at the front desk to the day I left, I could find nothing but positives about this good quality hotel. The decor is modern and clean.  The rooms are spacious The staff are courteous and friendly The security in the hotel is very good Restaurant and room service food is very good quality, if only lacking in choices. 2 minute walk to the Podium 5 minute walk to Robinsons Galleria 7 minute walk to Megamall 10 minute walk to Metrowalk  Looking forward to returning there soon."
279,October 2016,Very good hotel ,NA,50,Fantastic Hotel with clean and comfortable rooms. Special call out to the lovely Santi at reception and the amazing chef Marc who made my stay unforgettable. The lovely guy who cleans L23 is also one of the most helpful ataff I have ever met. I stayed in the hotel for work for a long stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone else. Convenient location amongst the malls as well.
280,September 2016,Fantastic location for business or leisure,NA,50,"Great location and fantastic facilities. The Gym is large and lots of weights / cardio options and access included in your night stay. Lots of people utilize the pool or spa for relaxation or exercise.   The rooms are very spacious and well equipped, go for the 1 bed and have some extra space and a separate lounge room. The kitchen is very well equipped with everything you would need to make your own food.  The breakfast and range / freshness is amazing, I am never without enjoying a delicious breakfast of fruit or eggs, asia or western inspired.   The hotel offers a spa for massage and facial and a car service pick up from the airport which is nice and easy.   I enjoy staying at this hotel because of the location however I keep coming back because of the friendly and supportive"
281,October 2016,Home away from home,NA,50,I have been blessed to be staying at the Oakwood for the last 9 months while on assignment in Manila. The Oakwood offers all the comforts of home with 5 star service that makes you feel like family. The rooms are gorgeous with high quality furniture and appliances. The bathtub is to die for. The breakfast buffet has more choices than you could ever want or need. However the best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone treats you like a friend from the restaurant to the doorman to the housekeeping staff. They will go out of their way to get you whatever you need. They are always friendly and professional and they have made this year so much easier in a foreign country just by being themselves. I will be glad to return to Canada soon but I will miss the friendly faces at the
282,October 2016,Quality condo-style accommodation,NA,40,"Oakwood suites occupy a building that has office accommodation at the front, on ADB Ave, and the hotel at the back on Topaz Ave.  You can go through the small corridor from the front entry to the hotel lobby at the back.  Check-in was a little cold (sorry Lala, try to smile a bit sweetie) but quite quick and efficient. The porter will take your bag and show you around your room.  The one-bedroom suite was very nice, quite large and with a kitchenette and washing machine. The furniture and fittings are all tasteful and in good condition.  You'll get the normal cable TV channels, but... no Discovery channel!  Hay naku!  Free WiFi is also provided and it is stable and quite fast.  The bathroom is quite attractive, with a large free-standing bath on one side.  But the shower heads"
283,May 2016,Excellent Value for Money,NA,40,"I stayed here in May 2015 and i should say this was indeed value for money. I know i am writing it late but hey, better late than sorry. I stayed in the studio apartment and the room was very spacious. It had a kitchen with oven, stove, microwave, fridge and coffee machine.The room also had a washing machine and dryer. Never tried the breakfast or lunch since i used to work late night and come back and crash in the morning. Nearby: Its about 2 minute walk from Robinsons Galleria and 5 minute walk is SM Megamall which is huge. Take a taxi and round the corner you will another mall. If you want to have an India Food there is a restaurant in Robinsons 5th floor.  So all in all a good business hotel, with all amenities, far from tourist zones and yet within reach."
284,July 2016,Staycation with friends,NA,40,It was the last day in ph of my partners cousin so they decided to check in a hotel so they can spend the whole night sharing stories with a few bottles of beer! We stayed in their 1 bedroom suite which was perfect since it has a complete kitchen a sala and had a kingsized bed inside the room. Check in was quick and easy. Location was perfect it was almost across podium and a few steps from rob galleria.
285,October 2016,Staycation with girlfriends,NA,50,I love everything about this place. Stayed in a 1 Bedroom Suite. Room size is extremely big. Actually I think the room might actually can accommodate 20 people in on time perfectly. Love the fixtures in the room. Kitchen is superb you have everything you might need.  We enjoyed the swimming pool area during the evening IT'S HEATED we love it. This place offers your every thing it's like owning your own condo unit. And location is absolutely nice walking distance to Robinsons Galleria and SM Megamall. And just a cross Podium. If incase you want some emergency foods in the middle of the night there is a Ministop at the back near the lobby area. I would highly recommend this place again to my friends for another staycation.
286,October 2016,"As published,met all of my expectations.",NA,40,Staffs were accomodating and attentive. Check-in was a breeze. Room was elegant and clean. I gave it a 4 because our room was situated infront of the street that had a construction going on - lots of noise. Tried to be moved but sadly denied. Thanks for the unexpected bday cake.
287,June 2016,First-rate hotel in the middle of Ortigas,NA,50,"We stayed here when we first moved to the Philippines, residing here for a full month. The staff are excellent, always extremely helpful, and providing a consistently superior service. The room was huge, with a well equipped kitchen, large living area, dining area and spacious bedroom and bathroom. We were on the 18th floor so had good views to the north, across Wack-Wack golf course and could see the sun set across OId Manila. The bathroom came complete with a bath and walk-in shower unit that could also function as a mini-steam room. Breakfast was excellent every morning, with a wide range of foods on offer from local breakfasts to European and Asian specialties. The hotel also had a very good exercise suite with plenty of weights, cardio machines, a dance studio and large lap"
288,September 2016,Great Staycation!,NA,50,"My fiancé and I decided to celebrate our anniversary in Oakwood...and we made a right choice. The hotel is superb plus all the staff are accommodating and very friendly. And I have to commend the front office team,Stephen, Marlon, Daryl and their supervisor Jake who helped us with our hassle-free check-in and even in check-out. From our luggage assist to our other requests, they attended well to the needs of their guests. Our room is very spacious and cozy and worth every penny. Also, a big thanks to Leo the housekeeping staff who assisted us with our requests that made our stay even more relaxing and convenient. This is a perfect place to spend the weekend or for a special occasion. Our experience in this hotel is exactly a good description of a home away from home."
289,September 2016,A home away from home,NA,50,Perfect for longer business trips. Having an apartment over a hotel room really helps make long trips more enjoyable.  Bed extremely comfortable. Amenities and facilities very good and at a good price. Staff were always very friendly and helpful.  Just a few minutes walk to the local malls and well located for travelling to sites around Manila.  Breakfast was included and despite some other reviewers I thought the selection was more than sufficient!
290,September 2016,wonderful hotel,NA,50,"Great location in manila and wonderful hotel. raccomended for family. Very confortable, wifi, free and great international food. Good for holiday in manila and the staff is very higlhy. raccomended..."
291,December 2015,The Best Serviced Hotel in Metro Manila,NA,40,"Our family has stayed in Oakwood Premier for 3 times and never has it dissatisfied us.  We like the 1 bedroom unit over the studio as it has separation of the different areas.  It has living and dining rooms, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom with tub.  The kitchen has complete cooking and eating amenities.  Refrigerator is full-sized.  A washing machine with dryer is also available.  Bed and pillows are comfortable.  There are 3 televisions - one each in the living, bed and bath rooms.  Indoor pool is heated and well-maintained.  Service is ok but not warm.  Check in line during the holidays is long as expected.  Breakfast and lunch buffet selection are few."
292,August 2016,Your Second Home,NA,50,"Oakwood Premier is a full service apartment style residence that would cater for a family's needs. It's an apartment with amenities of a multi star hotel. Their studio apartment comes with a kitchen, a washer/dryer, a small receiving area that can double up as your dining. Their one bedroom apartment is very spacious that you can even add up to 2 or even 3 extra beds!  They have an indoor pool, jacuzzi, gym and a kids play area. Location  is right smack at the commercial center of Ortigas. 3 malls are walking distance as well as several restaurants.  All in all, this is a good place for a staycation or even an extended stay. "
293,August 2016,Great staycation place,NA,40,"If you are looking for a getaway or quick break from your home, this place is highly recommended. It can cater from a couple to a bigger group - studio room, one, two and three bedrooms.  I have tried them all and I can say it's one of the best service apartments there is.  The rooms are quite huge compared to others.  The facilities and amenities are complete.  You have a workable kitchen with oven and stove, microwave oven, dishwasher and necessary kitchen utensils and cutleries. There is also a washing machine and dryer, iron and board.  It's like not leaving at home but with better facilities. I love the bath tub in every master's bedroom.  It has a TV so you can either just relax and read a book or watch TV.  I can't also forget how fuffly the pillows and comfortable the"
294,August 2016,Great Stay!,NA,50,"I stayed at Oakwood on ADB Avenue for the third time for a business trip.  It was an outstanding experience. The 1 BHK apartment  I stayed in was very well maintained, lush with all the required (and more) facilities and the services were great.   Staying at Oakwood has always been good, and I recommend the place to business travelers. Again business on ADB Avenue its located right at central point in Ortigas commercial space.   The food, services and the other hotel facilities (pool, gym) are well appointed. Just being a strict vegetarian, food sometimes becomes a challenge. Also there are several Indian options - like samosas, spring rolls, naan bread and so on, but some of them contain eggs - so strict vegetarians cannot have them. I would request the chef and management to"
295,August 2016,Our second home..,NA,40,"We stayed twice here in these month of August. Oakwood Premier's staff were very polite and friendly. I booked for two bedroom suite and got upgraded to three bedroom apartment at checkin. Although there was an incident happened in my room, the Front Office Manager and Housekeeping Executive were very professionals to handle the situation. Location of the hotel is very convenient to Sm Megamall and easy to find. Breakfast buffet is very good but quite pricey. In room massage is available 24 hours but again it is expensive.  I stayed in Rm 2705, the master bedroom's toilet seat need to be replaced -it looks old. Overall, I would rate these hotel 4.5/5. Will definitely come back again. "
296,August 2016,Breakfast items were same for the whole week. more varieties could be added.,NA,40,"I stayed for a week in the hotel. The service was superb and I would rate it as five star service in a true sense. I was highly impressed by the cleanliness/ tidiness of the room, quick response of the ever-smiling staffs and their readiness to assist, the restaurant, the gym and the room-service.  As I was on a business trip, I was expecting varieties of items in the breakfast. I felt a bit bored by seeing the same thing/item for all seven days I stayed in the hotel."
297,February 2016,More than what you paid for,NA,50,"Price may be a little bit steep but opening the door to the 1 BR suite, it more than made up for it.  The place was really huge!  It has a functioning kitchen, laundry, full-sized ref, living room, total of 3 TVs, full bath with a tub and sauna shower room.  Breakfast was superb as well.  I wish we can go back soon. "
298,May 2016,Birthday weekend,NA,40,"Overall the hotel was excellent. Location, food, amenities. The staff in the restaurant did an excellent job with the food and attended to my special request for a slice of cake and birthday song.  Just 1 comment on sound proof, though we were not very loud, the front desk kept calling to tone it down. "
299,January 2016,Happy place,NA,50,"Stayed last new year holiday. Good food, great staff big rooms. Pets are allowed so it's highly recommended for pet lovers like me. This is near to restaurants and in front of Podium. Very convenient! Two thumbs up for you guys!"
300,August 2016,Stayed in Oakwood last week,NA,50,"Visited Manila last week for business and stayed in Oakwood for 5 nights. The hotel and facilities is out of this world. Its advisable to book one of the suites/service apartment. To start with the temperature controlled swimming pool is apt for doing a few laps in the evening. Food served at the Nostalg restaurant is awesome, specially the desert ""choco lava cake"". Location wise the hotel is well accessible to one of the happening place in Pasig city, the Metrowalk. "
301,December 2015,Beautiful rooms!,NA,50,"Their 2-bedroom suite is a luxurious room packed with everything that you may need! Their rooms are very spacious, loved the bathrooms! I also liked the in-house restaurant/bar - food tasted well but on an expensive side."
302,July 2016,Good base of operations - for Ortigas,NA,40,"Great hotel, very clean and modern, well maintained. Its location is great if you need to be around the Ortigas area, however traffic in the area is pretty crippling even by Metro Manilas overall standards, its not unusual to get stuck for 45 mins to travel 2kms in the Ortigas area.  It is set up well to cater to business travelers. Good restaurants in the area, and Megamall for shoppers in walking distance. Excellent breakfast buffet. In house bar and in room dining are on the high end, so I would recommend venturing out."
303,June 2016,Cool Place for a Bridal Shower,NA,50,"We had a very fun bridal shower for a friend here.  Best to check special deals which is always available.  Room can accommodate a full load of barkada or an extended family.  Nice staycation venue within the city.  They do allow deliveries so no worries when it comes to food, it just needs to pick it up at the lobby.  The room is big and complete. Perfect for a short term stay. Wit full amenities --- washing machine, oven, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, the whole lot.  There's also a tv inside the bathroom, and a personal sauna.  Would be a lovely place to stay for couples. =)"
304,June 2016,Would be 5🌟 If the front desk didn't have such an attitude!,NA,40,"This was one of the best and most complete hotels I've stayed at in all of Asia and in the US. Beautiful suites, best restaurant in the business (Nostalgia), great little cigar bar (although I would have liked to see imported cigars). The only downside was the horrible attitude of the front desk clerk. Sadly I don't remember her name, but she spoke with a very condescending tone. Rare to say the least, particularly in the Philippines."
305,August 2015,Great Luxury Apartments,NA,40,"The check-in was a breeze and location very walk-able to nearby stores, restaurants and mall. Room sized were pretty descent and spotless so that was good. They have few restaurants in the hotel which were good and service was superb. The gym and pool were pretty clean and had a good size didn't get crowded even on rush hours. My minor disappointment was the centralized Air conditioned, this had made the room a little warm for me. Overall I would recommend staying here!"
306,July 2016,Great apartments,NA,50,Fantastic value.  Apartments are well appointed with great facilities.  Nice and clean.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Meals were great with a good selection.  Location is really convenient.  Would recommend and stay again.
307,July 2016,excellent value for money,NA,40,"We stayed here for my son's birthday this July. We stayed at their one bedroom suite.It was very spacious to our delight. I made a booking thru booking.com much earlier so I had a good deal. First of all, The hotel employees are courteous and accommodating we didn't encounter any problem with them during our stay. The room feels like one is at home because almost everything you need to cook is present. There were dishwasher, washing machine ang iron. However, The lid of the electric kettle was a bit broken. I also cannot make a local directly. I had to have the guest relations connext me. It's a bit of a hassle since we order most of our foods thru delivery. We also have to request for a hand towel since none is provided upon arrival. Also, only 1 toothbrush is provided when the"
308,June 2016,"Excellent Hotel - Large rooms, super gym and lovely staff",NA,50,"The room i stayed in on the 20th floor was big and tastefully furnished. It was actually a studio ""apartment"" room and so came with an equipped kitchenette.  The restaurant breakfast was of a high standard with enough variety to suit different tastes. Dinner is also served at the restaurant and service is quick. Another thing that I really like about this hotel is the very well equipped gym and clean swimming pool. Top notch! However, the main reason for rating this hotel so high is the staff. From the reception to the restaurant, everyone was helpful and ready to serve (with a smile). I must specially mention Glesie who was a great hostess. in addition to managing the meeting room we utilized for our seminar and ensuring it met our requirements, she assisted in organizing a"
309,July 2016,Good sized rooms,NA,50,"I stayed here for 2 weeks due to the close proximity of where i needed to work (it was across the road). The staff were welcoming and friendly and each time I would come back from the shops they would help carry my bags to the room. The room was very spacious, I stayed in the studio apartment and the room was very spacious. It had a kitchen with oven, stove, microwave, fridge and coffee machine. The bathroom was large with a shower that also turned into a sauna. The room also had a washing machine and dryer! The Breakfast was great and had everything you could need, Bacon, egg station where you could request your eggs to be cooked how you like, fruit, cereal, asian dishes, breads pastries and sushi. I went to the dining room for dinner a few times and even though it was a little"
310,December 2015,Five stars,NA,50,"The rooms at Oakwood are excellent. Every appliance you could ask for, spacious, modern and comfortable. There are a lot of hotels in the area, but none that I know of provide quite as much. I've stayed twice for 13 and 24 nights and haven't once needed something that wasn't either already there or a quick phone call away.  But what makes Oakwood stand out the most are the staff. Everyone is polite, courteous and helpful. They go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect, right down to details like brushing the tassels of the rug straight. I'd made a request before my second stay to be booked into the same room as my first, which seemed not to be possible, but on arrival I was told that it had been freed up. One of the porters said he recognised me from my stay two"
311,June 2016,Good for business,NA,40,"I stayed for 6 nights, in first week of June 2016 on a business trip. Why?  Firstly it came recommended by office colleagues who have stayed there in previous years;  Secondly it is just across the road from ADB where I had work and  Thirdly, as a vegetarian I wanted to stay in a service apartment with kitchenette just incase… The rooms are big with separate spaces for writing desk, sitting area, closet, wash room and the kitchen. The kitchen is well equipped with cutlery for two.  However, don’t expect any provisions like sugar/ salt / pepper/ washing liquid etc. If you really intend to cook better bring your own provisions or order these separately.  I however, did not feel the need to do any of this and got the time to spend at the well-equipped gym and the swimming pool. In"
312,June 2016,Relaxing Staycation,NA,50,"Oakwood Hotel in Pasig City is situated in the business district. Room space is quite bigger as compared to other hotels in the Philippines. The room we occupied has a living room, kitchenette equipped with modern tools & amenities, 2 large TV sets, & one small TV set in front of a big bath tub whereby you can watch while taking a bath. It has in-room steam bath, a big modern washing machine with dryer, & even a flat iron. The bath room is very neat & nice. Beds & sofas are big and comfortable. The hotel has an in-door swimming pool with heated Jacuzzi, business center where you can borro books & CDs. Buffet breakfast is also great & the restaurant is also elegant. Price is reasonable. Over-all, oakwood is superb. That's why even Pres. Duterte & his family chose to stay here"
313,June 2016,nice but isn't perfect,NA,30,"I visited the place when I've read to almost all the reviews how memorable their stayed was...I may say it's quiet nice to be at Oakwood in Ortigas.Food is OK, but I've more familiar at the customer service."
314,June 2016,Good place to stay for work related travel,NA,40,"The hotel is perfect for families moving to or from Manila. Spacious rooms with an equipped kitchen and even a washing machine. Very good for longer stays, but not so good for tourism. During the week the hotel is quiet, while in the weekend there are more families and private events. Located central in the Ortigas Center Business District a short walk from the Megamall. "
315,June 2016,Great stay ,NA,40,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 months while in Manila for business. Rooms are very accommodating with a full kitchen, dining and lounge area. Great whiskey bar which turns in to a smoking lounge after 5:30pm. Room service is a bit pricy but food was ok, plenty of places to eat within a shot distance of the hotel. Mega mall, Robertson's, star mall, the podium and the Shang are all within walking distance.   Recommend for business and pleasure.  "
316,December 2015,Perfect for Long Staying Guest in Ortigas,NA,40,"I stayed in a 1 Br suite. The room is very clean and huge. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower with a small tv. This hotel is perfect for family, business travellers and couples staying long term. I love their kitchenette because it is well-equipped and fully furnished - even a dishwasher and a front load washer came in handy. Everything you need is provided. Also, I have no complaints about customer service. "
317,June 2016,Best Room WORST Staff,NA,20,"I called a day before and reqeusted for an early check-in since my parents will be arriving Manila by 9AM. I requested and they have it noted and need to call in the morning for a confirmation. The next day I called at 8 in the moning and talked to the RUDE Jake of Front Desk, telling me that dont expect to have your rooom be available from any moment, the room will be available by 3pm, without remorse, I requested for a call back if ever the room will be available earlier. We went to the hotel by 2:30 without any callback hoping we could check in and wait for 30-min in the lobby, at 3PM the room is stil not available, after the accommodating frontdesk supervisor went to the room and have it inspected it by herself twice, the room is still not available and ask the security to"

319,December 2015,5 Star accomodation.,NA,50,"we booked for the 2 bedroom executive. room was delayed for 1 hour upon check-in, understandably because the room was huge. everything inside the room was elegant. views from the room was amazing. the toliet and bath was modern. everyting was excellent."
320,October 2015,"Spacious rooms, heated pool, and good fitness center",NA,50,"The 1BR and 2BR that we got were both spacious, clean, and good! The bed and beddings were all comfortable and clean! AC was functioning well. The rooms have bath tub, and with TVs in the comfort rooms! You can have sauna in the comfort rooms as well! Internet/wifi in the rooms was fast.  The living room was also spacious and good. We used the washing machine, and we were amazed! The dining area was good as well. There were cookwares and utensils that guests can use.  The swimming pool was heated and quite big. There was also jacuzzi. The fitness center was quite big also and the view while you're doing treadmill was  good as well.  Buffet breakfast was okay, food was yummy, but the selection was kind of few.  Staff were all helpful and accommodating.   Will be staying here"
321,June 2016,Too pricey for its brand of service,NA,30,"We've stayed at Oakwood several times before, usually booking a 2-bedroom unit, though we booked a studio unit only this time.   THE GOOD  1. The units are well-maintained and nicely decorated. The curtains could use more frequent thorough vacuuming.   2. The pool is indoor and perfectly thermoregulated.  THE BAD  1. Do we really have to PAY for ice? We've stayed in other serviced apartments and we have always been given a bucket of ice upon request, no charge, no problem. There is a refrigerator/freezer in every unit here in Oakwood, but there is NO ICE TRAY where guests can make their own ice. Go figure.  2. Amenities are sparse but available upon request. Still, it should not be necessary for guests to ask for some basic bathroom items such as face towels and hand towels.  3."
322,April 2016,In between,NA,30,"Been here for my daughter's birthday. We made a request for early check in a day before but was neither granted nor denied, the receptionist seems not good with words since the way she answered felt like she's actually saying no. First off, the hotel have a spacious but somehow odd shaped lobby, the sitting/waiting/lounge area is too far apart from the receptionist. We were assisted with our luggages, i think there was 4 lifts so it was a breeze going to our room. We reserved for one bedroom with fully functioning kitchen which i loved by the way. Upon opening the door we were greeted with the kitchen to our left and a very spacious sitting area which my kids absolutely loved, instead of just staring to their ipads they keep on running and playing around. I adore the clean"
323,May 2016,still the best room but still poor service,NA,30,"this is our nth time to check in at oakwood (every year for annual doctors convention) but first time for a studio room which is i will never recommend first i don't know what partition this kind of room you better refurbished all the room (a little make over because sooner it will be outdated). When i say poor service it's the front desk they never make you feel that you are welcome in the hotel no smiling face or warm reception to you i dont get it why they are always in the computer or seems busy eventhough theres no queue. second, the buffet breakfast and lunch you better change your menus you going to pay same amount of buffet in 4 star hotel but with many selections at oakwood no selections at the same time look pale. the best part of our stay when we transfer in one"
324,February 2016,Great for small parties,NA,50,"If you're looking for a place to hold a small party, this hotel is perfect. We held my friend's baby shower here last February. We reserved a 1BR suite which is spacious. 20 people fit in the living area. This was the second time we held baby shower, first was mine. They allow guests to stay until 10 but not so strict with this. Kitchen is also fully equipped so we were able to prepare foods for the guests. Washing machine and iron are also available. For me, it's also ideal for staycation. "
325,April 2016,"Great Stay, good food, nice amenities",NA,50,"We have stayed in the hotel last month. All i can say is we just fell in love with the room.  We can prepare our food since the hotel provide basic utensils.   Room is big , it can cater to big families. Service is superb , no hassle during check in and check out.  Overall, we are very satisfied with the service , food and the room :)"
326,November 2015,"Always, a great experience!",NA,50,"Stayed here several times already and always it is a perfect experience (during a staycation with ex-bf-now-hubby, my bridal shower and during our wedding preparations).   (a) Receptionists are very accommodating (shout out to Mica if you are still there ^^) (b) They are very lax with incoming food, always great service from the hotel staff if ever we need anything especially for cooking food (we like to utilize their kitchen).  (c)They offer solutions to any inconveniences to the guests - During wedding preps when they cannot offer me 5 rooms on the same floor, they gave us access cards that can access all the 5 rooms even if given on different floors. (d) Very accommodating to events - one of the favorite hotels for weddings.  (e) Higher rooms have better views. (f) Everyone"
327,April 2016,"sincere hospitality, excellent service",NA,50,"Some hotels claim to be luxurious, some hotels have luxurious amenities but staff with fake smiles.  Oakwood Premier is the only hotel in Manila with well-maintained interiors and a service staff that makes you feel totally welcome.  Yes it's not a huge hotel and it doesn't have large ballrooms, a big spa or a huge outdoor pool as it's really more of a Business Hotel but the place is just so cozy you would wish you lived there."
328,May 2016,Love It,NA,40,"Very organized, clean. Unlike some hotels u can hear the sound of those cars outside, this hotel is so quiet. Love how I dip myself at the bathtub with my rubber ducky. I recommend this hotel to everyone. U want a very peaceful room, try this 1, u won't regret it."
329,January 2016,Admirable Space and Convenience,NA,40,"Pros:  Dedicated free parking for staying in guests.  A very spacious living room separate from an equally spacious bedroom is just fantastic.  Rooms complete with a kitchenette, washing machine with dryer, microwave, nook and dinner table for four.  Heated pools with clean and well-lit shower rooms.  Very convenient location being in close proximity to numerous restaurants and cafés.  Cons:  Internet is a bit of a struggle, having to log-in every time the room is left.  TV needs updating since it can not be connected to a modern hard disk.  Breakfast buffet was average, nothing really stands out.  Note: We got the room for Php 7,000.00 per night and it was a good deal. Above this rate, we might think twice already."
330,May 2016,Never Comming Back,NA,10,"The size of the room is quite big.  their location is good.  However the hotel staffs are verry lousy especially their housekeeping department.  we checked in as 3 person and requested for an extra bed.  they did not provide 3 toiletries (ex. toothbrush & towels) we requested for 5 extra pillows and their front office acknowledged it then when the housekeeping came they only brought 2 extra pillows, the guy also said that they only have 2 pillows left.  they are lying, the just dont want to give an extra pillow.  as for the towels and complimentary water they will only give you 2.  You have to pay aditional if you want to have them. That is what their FO staff said (May 5,2016 11:00pm the hotel can trace that particular FO staff).  Never the less their split type AC are also"
331,April 2016,"Good Location, Good Facilities, Friendly Staff, Some niggles",NA,30,"The hotel is well located in Ortigas close to Robinsons Galleria, Mega Mall, EDSA etc.  The room (1 Bedroom Deluxe) was large and well furnished and convenient with washing machine, cooking facilities etc.  I would however only rate this Hotel a 3-3.5 for the following reasons: Cleanliness in the room is not good. There was dust and dirt on the floors and under furniture.  Bathroom was not cleaned properly each day, including the toilet which started to smell. Shower was blocked and started to flood. We reported this Not enough towels Bathroom amenities not replenished. Swimming Pool area is not clean, especially around the pool, where our shoes and feet became dirty after a swim. The water does not seem especially clean either and did not have that distinct clean pool smell you"
332,February 2016,We love this hotel,NA,40,"Our family had a pleasant stay in their 2 bed room suite. Kids were so happy and we all had a nice time. Amenities are all modern and you will not feel yucky to use the kitchen utensils.  My 11 year old daughter bumped her head (corner part near the stairs) while swimming in the pool, the attendant hurriedly gave us some ice and their manager/in-house doctor also checked on my daughter. Thank you!"
333,April 2016,Sauna-reffic,NA,50,"We got a 3-bedroom room for our team building and I was happy to see that it was spacious with a good enough size kitchen. Although, at first I find the living room uninviting when I entered because of the boring colours (grey-brown-black) theme. But if you go each of the rooms you find that the room and furnitures are well taken cared for. I love that the 2 big rooms have a television set. Each rooms have good size bathrooms. The fun part was the sauna in the master's bedroom plus bath tub. I really loved and enjoyed the sauna which you rarely find in most hotels.   There is a kitchen and I like the fact that you can do what you want like cook complete with the appliances and utensils. Too bad I didn't know ahead. If you are not the cooking type you can easily go out and check"
334,November 2015,Best Stay,NA,50,"Probably one of the best staycations we had stayed in. We had our own kitchen and a sauna in our bathroom.  We only had one concern, the food delivery had to be picked up downstairs. It was a bit of a hassle but all in all it wasn't a big deal.   I dont have any other comments as it was perfect! "
335,April 2016,"Excellent service, superb amenities and family oriented",NA,50,"Me and my Family stayed at Oakwood Premier - Ortigas and I definitely recommend it for a ""family staycation"". We rented 2 x 1BR suite, the room is huge with complete set of utensils, kitchenware and laundry appliance. You have the option to buy groceries and cook or dine at their restaurant. Podium Mall is just across the street while Megamall is only a 5-10 minutes walk. Service is excellent. The pool area is great for kids as well, they allow maximum of 4 person to swim for free (each room). For weekend stay with full guest, it may take 5 minutes or more to attend to your need but it is understandable. The hotel staff and guest receptionists are all accommodating and professional."
336,April 2016,"Good location, spacious room",NA,40,"Booked a studio and was nicely surprised to find a spacious one, with a very good bed, a full kitchen, a steam bathroom, even a secluded corner to work on my laptop. The staff was helpful. On the first two nights I had a blissful sleep, but unfortunately neighbors conversing loudly until the wee hours disturbed the third and fourth. The check-in at 3pm was also a minus."
337,April 2016,"Nice property, good location, unprofessionally managed!",NA,40,"first time I've stayed here. based on the brand i chose this, as where i normally stay in Ortigas was full. reasonable level of service at check in etc. i would say the downside is any room attendance needed was slow or incorrect. first night i noticed only one wine glass. next day i told the staff. it took another call the following day. i was initially told they would rent another glass. i asked, as this was an apartment, did they really think one wine glass was sufficient! finally got the glass. however, the next evening i needed to open a can. as there was a full kitchen, one would expect a can opener. first i was brought a cork screw (as it happened the corkscrew in the room was bent). then i showed the can and finally got a can opener but less than functional. it looked"
338,April 2016,Nice and convenient,NA,40,"The back of hotel faces the Asian Development Bank. It is a few hundred meters away from Podium (an upscale shopping mall) and about 10 minutes away on foot from SM Megamall where I had some business for a few days.  Check-in was quick and efficient. The room was spacious and well equipped. A washing machine and work station were hidden away near the window. There is ample closet space and a kitchen with basic appliances and kitchen items. The bathroom was nicely done. In this neighborhood there isn't much that one can hope for by way of a view so the fact that my room faced a construction site was fine.  While you could hear movement in the corridors, noise from other rooms or from the street was never a problem.  WiFi is free but is limited to four devices per room.  The"

341,April 2016,Wonderful stay with family and kids. A hotel that has everything you could ever wish for.,NA,50,"We booked a 2BR executive suite for a night to celebrate my brother's 30th birthday. We are delighted to be in a well- appointed room with everything you can wish for.   The kids loved the tub (actually wanted their own tub at home). My dad and husband were obsessed with the kitchen complete with everything you can imagine, from a coffee maker to  baking utensils.   It was so convenient, because it was near huge malls. There was a 711 a few steps from the hotel, so if you forgot to bring anything, you can quickly pop into the store.   We loved pool time at this hotel, too. Although it can get quite crowded (summer in the PH is brutally hot), we had fun swimming and felt safe because there was a lifeguard watching.   One of our own glass containers got mixed up with the hotel's"
342,April 2016,Road to Forever,NA,50,"We chose to stay at the Oakwood Premier since our friend who's getting married also stayed their. At first we are hesitant to book here because we are 5 persons checking in. But the price of their room was reasonable so it's a go! I was just expecting a common hotel, with rest room, bed and a tv. But this hotel is very different from the others. They have a small kitchen, a big closet, an iron and a washing machine in the room. Can you imagine that? Haha! That's very convenient!  They have an indoor pool, and guys mind you.. They are very strict when it comes to swimming attire. If you are planning to go there, please call first the hotel so they can tell you the proper attire for swimming or else you don't want to swim naked. Hahaha! Just kidding :) We are very satisfied with"
343,March 2016,3 days staying in Oakwood Premier Joy,NA,50,"It is the best hotel I ever been, not only the rooms or the services, mainly the staff and the threatment. I would like to highlight the attention of the Receptions named Jennifer, it was simply beyond my expectations. Thank you Jennifer"
344,March 2016,Doggie approved!,NA,40,"Instead of going somewhere far to celebrate our dog's birthday, we decided to stay here for a change of environment. Oakwood is a fave in the Ortigas area. A big plus as it's one of the few pet-friendly hotels in the metro. My son enjoyed swimming as I relaxed in the plush bed. The kitchen came in very handy when we reheated left-over food. We all loved the tub with the TV. Would stay again in the future. "
345,August 2015,Quality of service,NA,40,"I had a wonderful experience at this hotel. Clean rooms that were well equipped and designed to accommodate guests from anywhere in this world. The service and quality is truly international. The hotel management were very helpful and professional because when we checked out one of our colleagues misplaced her Ipad at the checking in/out area which was sent by hotel authorities to her country in Africa via couriers. Within two days the lady received her Ipad. I also recommend visitors to his hotel because of their respect for visitors' varying cultures. No segregation at all, their approach to business is truly international."
346,February 2016,Joyful Staycation In my Mind,NA,40,"Truly, every time we stay here in this part of Ortigas, we feel joyful. I have been a member of their Oakwood Premier for years and this membership, I never gave up, unlike the others I had for nearby hotels.  My family and I enjoy our staycation here because, we simply walk to our favorite restaurants inside Podium (a mall across this hotel). Likewise, well known malls like, SM Megamall, Robinsons and Shangrila are both nearby. If you happened to be staying on a Sunday and you want to attend the Holy Mass, there are choices of Catholic Churches nearby. Simply ask the concierge or front desk for mass schedule and directions. The rooms are spacious and clean including their modern kitchen system. The staff are courteous and nice. Their gym got a state of the art equipments. And"
347,March 2016,"Very comfortable, spacious and central location",NA,50,"The location is ideal for both business and leisure travelers. Centralize location amidst tourist venues and entertainment. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and provided a myriad of amenities. The customer service is definitely one I will remember most. From the moment I arrived to the time I checked-out, staff were attentive and prompt. Great service."
348,December 2015,3d2n Staycation,NA,40,We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite.  Room was HUGE!   Room is best for long staying guests since they have a spacious kitchen and dining table for 4 complete w/ cookware.  They even offer butler service to buy your ingredients if you're too lazy to go to the grocery. (SM is 10-15mins walking from the hotel)  Breakfast was a bit disappointing though.   But i give this hotel a 4 for the tub w/ TV🛀   
349,March 2016,perfect vibe,NA,50,"I asked my sister to book a hotel room for two nights as I was preoccupied by my to-do list before I leave the country. To my surprise, it's in Ortigas. I actually expect somewhere near the airport like Sofitel, Midas, City of Dreams... I'm not really familiar with the area because I used to live in Metro Manila and this place could really eat me up alive if I'm left alone in the city even just for a day. So, best solution is to use the ever helpful Google Map. We arrived at the lobby that didn't look much like a hotel lobby. I asked the security guard if we got the correct building, and he said yes. Only, we should have used the other door. It is a commercial building and the side we entered into was meant for the offices on the upper floors. There's a small door which leads to"
350,February 2016,Feb stay in Ortigas,NA,50,"My favorite choice of stay in Ortigas and a returning guest since 2012.  Never a disappointment as a traveler finding a comfortable, relaxing place and within walking distance 5mins to Robinsons Mall n Ortigas. Overall the room is hugh, clean, fully kitchen w washer/dryer included.  No issues with the WIfi and there is a steam shower in the room. Guest service always helpful & always a satisfied customer."
351,February 2016,A Pleasant Stay,NA,40,"Great place to stay even if the location is slightly out of the way from the main shopping areas of Makati.   The room I had even came with it's own washing machine but it was oddly placed in a corner next to the study desk that was located in a narrow part of the room.  The size of the room itself was very spacious and came with a small kitchenette. This is good for business travelers who may be staying longer term.  Breakfast itself was OK, and the ambiance is actually quite nice."
352,April 2015,Gem in the City,NA,40,"This was way back then 2013, only doing review now because the place hadn't change,  Good: Food, Rooms, Service, Staff  Cons:  Dim rooms on the one bed rooms, choose the 2 bed rooms you won't regret it  Staff service is good, i was asking something even thou i am not check in yet, they give me all the information that i need to be able to do what i am supposed to do.  Security is good also, Good doing Business meetings  will try this place again this coming April  "
353,March 2016,"Many Visits, All Good",NA,50,"I have stayed here many times over the years and it is always very good. The rooms are huge, extremely well appointed and comfortable. The staff is great as is breakfast, and the gym is another major plus. There are also countless places to eat in the area. The surroundings aren't Makati, but if this is a good location for your work, then this is a good choice. "
354,February 2016,Great place for a staycation!,NA,50,Stayed here during the Chinese New Year long weekend.  I was pleasantly surprised upon entering the room. It was amazing! Very spacious and luxurious.   Service was great too! Everyone from the parking attendant to the reception and house keeping staff were friendly and quick to act.  The hotel is in a good location. There are 4 malls around it that you can easily walk to. The hotel is also conveniently surrounded by restaurants and cafes!
355,January 2016,Busy business spot,NA,30,"The Oakwood is an older hotel, decorated in a style that I could only call, Grandma's Condo Chic.  You'll really notice it when you go to the restaurant.  That said, it is comfortable and well located by many malls. (There is a kids play zone in the Galleria Mall).  Travel time in mid-afternoon from NAIA was 1.5 hours, so not as bad as it could be.  I used the workout room (good facilities, good free weights), the pool (25 yard pool) and we took advantage of the room service. The PIZZA was very good.  We had a one bedroom suite and it was quite spacious. The washer-dryer combo unit was okay, but it took about 2.5 hrs to dry a regular load.  Though the hotel is quite good, we decided not to stay here for any of our Manila stays - see my other reviews for my favourite"
356,February 2016,A wonderful choice for location and comfort,NA,50,"My husband and I stayed at the Oakwood after two weeks of travelling. It was a comfortable stay and a wonderful break from the busy travel schedule we had endured. The service is excellent, the room is large, clean, modern and smartly laid out. The in room washer and dryer was perfect for us to refresh our clothing. The kitchen was not that well stocked, but I am confident that if i actually needed any item in particular that they would provide it.  We didn't have a chance to enjoy the breakfast or dining room so can't comment. Room service however, was easily ordered and quickly delivered :)   The fitness area was nice. Great equipment, a small studio space and a nice pool. The sauna was probably the hottest dry sauna I had ever entered - so hot i couldn't directly touch the"
357,February 2016,"Cramp hotel for conferences, weird building set-up, valet staff unprofessional",NA,10,"This review is only for their business conference amenities, not for any of their rooms or accomodations. It is just about my experience in attending a supply chain conference this February 2016.  First of all, it is a shared building with the Joy-Nostalg Center, which I find inconvenient as you can't tell where the front or the rear of the building is. I only found after that Oakwood is on one end and Joy Nostalg on the other. There are four elevators, two that give you access to the Oakwood lobby, the other two to Joy-Nostalg. I found that out after I got in the wrong one and ended up on the other side. You can access both entrances from the outside, but once inside, you can't. In other words, since I took the wrong elevator I had to walk outside the perimeter of the hotel."
358,February 2016,Great Business Hotel,NA,40,"My recent stay at Oakwood was great, the rooms are large, very clean and the bed very comfortable. The dining and bar is fine, food is good and consistent. Menu is not very road, but, something for everyones taste. The morning breakfast is quite good. Highly recommend this hotel, aslo great location."
359,February 2016,Comfortable base in Ortigas close to nice restaurants,NA,40,"Very pleasant hotel in great location in central Ortigas. Had a one bedroom deluxe, very spacious and nicely furnished suite with a large bathroom with both bath and shower and two basins (useful if a couple). Breakfast buffet offered a good variety of food with Chinese and Japanese options as well as western. Gym functional with some good aerobic machines and indoor pool very pleasant. Bar area with reasonable ambience. Suites have kitchen area and large fridge and within a hundred metres there is one Mini mart and one 7-Eleven so can stock up with water, San Miguel, etc. About 10-15 minutes walk from Marufuku Japanese and Bangkok Café Thai restaurants off San Miguel Ave just past the Linden Suites. Both offer good dining options. Other eating options around junction of ADB and"
360,February 2016,Great food for great company,NA,40,"Went for a lunch meeting with friends. The food was excellent, especially the fruit platter. The service was very friendly. We went to one of the suite rooms which was converted to a meeting area for about 15 people. It was very spacious and with the view of the central business district. Will go back for sure."
361,February 2016,Nice hotel,NA,50,Their smiles from staffs at the reception make us feel welcome and also even bellman they are all nice and thoughtful .... My fiancee was happy for this stay and we have book for the suite room 1110 very nice roomm must try ... 
362,January 2016,Excellent Stay,NA,50,"It was great staying in Oakwood, twice, on my business trips to Manila in January 2016.  Staff is very courteous and services efficient. Housekeeping is prompt. Morning breakfast offer many choices. Gym instructors are very good.."
363,March 2015,Great Stay At The Oakwood,NA,40,I was on a business trip working at Makati for five weeks and the Oakwood made me feel at Home. I had a condo style apartment with full kitchen sauna room beautiful washroom and super comfortable bed. The great customer service and friendly staff was just what i needed for this long and work filled trip. The morning breakfast buffet saved my life as i was working nights and finished work just at breakfast time. Great food.
364,January 2016,Excellent customer service,NA,50,"We had a smooth check-in and check-out experience. We were expecting that it will take long since there lots of people. Wedding team and guests checking in with families. Front desk staff are professional specially the tall guy Omar. He really went his way to keep smiling while assisting us and other guest. He made sure that we enjoy our stay until we check-out. He even called us after we check-in to check if everything is fine Great job to Maggie of housekeeping too. She is friendly. Cheers to Omar and Maggie! Location wise, very nice. Lots of malls nearby. Restaurant was just fine, Pool was great with music but was not able to hear it though. Did not use the gym, but they said its fine. Over all, great hotel. Would love to check in again."
365,January 2016,Business with pleasure,NA,40,"Very quick check in and check out without missing on any detail. The room was filled with modern furniture and amenities. The toilet and bath, your own kitchen, the huge tv -- everything is placed perfectly for one's pleasurable stay. Great location for business and shopping. But with all these good things, it's the courtesy of the staff that I will remember."
366,December 2015,"Comfortable Stay, Great Customer Service and a Special Memory",NA,50,"It must have been the large window lighting the living area that made it felt so cozy and very welcoming indeed. Then I can’t help noticing ease of movement and ample spaces for just about anything a normal traveller would bring. The kitchen, self-serve laundry and ironing facilities were a bonus. Bathroom was clean and amenities were not in shortage. We had the one bedroom – large enough to accommodate had we opted to add a single bed. The king bed we had with its linen offering a feel of freshness and cleanness was a place to curl up after a hectic day and when the curtain closed – tranquillity – A Comfortable Stay. Greeted with smiles amidst phone calls and people either checking in or out - fair share of warm welcome. It started with a simple inquiry without expectations but"
367,January 2016,Comfortable business travel hotel,NA,40,Excellent location for business travel and a very comfortable suites format hotel. Good rooms and very spacious. Restaurant and gym and spa are more than adequate. Good choice for a business travel to Manila.
368,January 2016,Salamat po! Thank you for making my stay in the Philippines a wonderful experience!,NA,50,This was my first time visiting the Philippines and I was very apprehensive about my visit.  Thank goodness for the staff at the Oakwood Premier Joy who helped make my stay very carefree and enjoyable.  I was greeted warmly and the staff were very professional in assisting me with my needs. The room was modern and had all the amenities of home including a full kitchen and steam bath.  The view was okay (overlooking the business district of Ortigas) for the most part. There was some construction noise from a site directly located next to the hotel but it wasn't that bothersome to me as I was gone during the daytimes and at night it was peaceful. Maid service insured that I had a clean room and fresh towels every evening and also provided free bottles of water every day which was
369,September 2015,Great for a conference or meeting at the ADB,NA,50,"For a conference or meeting at the Asian Development Bank this apartment hotel is highly recommended. Just cross the road to the entrance of the ADB! The apartment was luxurious and great to stay in – I slept like a log and enjoyed the space. Good internet service kept me aware of what was happening in the world. I also enjoyed a pick-up service from the airport and a return service, which was organized by the ADB, but I understood the hotel offers the same. I’d certainly recommend it."
370,January 2016,Worth coming back,NA,40,"Overall good experience. The lobby was simple and had two entrances that wasn't that grand but their hotel room was outstanding. We checked in a one bedroom suite and all the expectations were granted for the bathroom and bedroom. Check in and check out was a breeze and they granted us an earlier check in and a later check out.  We had a slight problem with the living room though,  their TV was broken and it only displays negative images. We had to follow this up 3x and we couldn't go down and had to wait for around an hour for this. What we didn't like was that they gave us a certain number of minutes for them to resolve the case but wasn't able to commit to that. In the end, they brought a big TV as replacement. Another thing to note is the lamp. One lamp beside the sofa was"
371,March 2015,Definitely our second home!,NA,50,"Went here March of 2015, and since then has become one of my favorite hotels in the Metro. If you are looking for a  hotel that resembles a home, then I'd definitely recommend Oakwood Premier. It has a kitchen, complete with all utensils, even electric stove, oven, fridge, and cookwares. It comes also with a washing machine, a flat iron, and a sauna!! My favorite part of our suite, was the tub! It's faced towards the beautiful view of the towering buildings of Ortigas. Not to mention that the restroom has a TV too! This is actually the first hotel I know with 3 television units inside the suite - living area, room, restroom! Their pool area and shower room are impressively clean. Plus the staff is very nice and attentive to our needs. We're too fascinated with this hotel that we"
372,January 2016,Enjoying Hotel Luxury in a city,NA,50,"Oakwood is a perfect hotel for corporates on weekdays and also for a family or couple's getaway on a weekend. I like their room amenities such as steam shower room, dishwashing machine, washing machine, microwave, induction stove and a huge refrigerator. Staff are all prompt and accommodating. "
373,January 2016,Comfortable For Staycation,NA,30,"Spent new year's eve with my family here. We booked 2 one bedroom suites. Good thing we were given adjoining rooms. The rooms are big, clean and well equipped. A/C is strong with good wifi connection. It is also pet friendly. The staff were kinda inconsistent though because we paid full rate but was not given complementary breakfast unlike those who booked on discounted rate but were given the privilege. Food in the restaurant is not so good though so better not waste your time over it. "
374,January 2016,Stopover ,NA,40,"Great hotel.  4.5 star.  Great service and accommodations.  The rooms are well kept, modern and functional.  Wifi is blazing! Room service prompt.  The lobby is underwhelming but who cares...about a 5 min walk from Robinsons place and Crown.  The washer and dryer a +++. I would def stay again. "
375,December 2015,Perfect for our ong term stay,NA,50,"Stayed 9-nights at a 2-bedroom suite, #2502 during the holiday season. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. We checked in late and checked out early and both interactions with the front desk staff were excellent. Due to the holiday, we noticed that the lobby was crowded during peak afternoon hours but the staff seem to manage that well.  We traveled as a family with two kids. Like everyone else have mentioned, having a kitchen and laundry are definite pluses. Their appliances are all top notch (Samsung, Black and Decker, etc.) and worked very well. Daily cleaning service is included and is very nice. I only wish they had smaller plates that actually fit better in the cabinet and dishwasher (totally nitpicking here!). We had 4 and I felt that I was constantly washing"
376,January 2016,Just one glitch- the wireless phone and play area,NA,30,We visited our family members twice who actually are checked in the hotel.  We passed through the Nostalg centre's entrance along ADB Avenue. The evening we visited had a rugby smell which was (as the staff explained) the wax applied to the floors. The smell was from the Nostalg centre.  The hotel lobby was bright and well presented. The hotel staff were quite attentive to our needs.  The room was equipped with current technology appliances. We had some difficulty using the dishwasher as we could not find the manual or a quick tips card. I was a bit surprised that even though the lock light was on we could still open the dishwasher. The bedroom and bathroom were well presented.  We could not however used the wireless phone in the bedroom. We tried calling our other family
377,December 2015,Excellent rooms for long-term guests,NA,40,"Stayed in a 2-bedroom suite for a day. Spacious rooms with a great view of Ortigas. The location is great as it is near the huge malls like SM Megamall and Robinsons Galleria (approximately 5-minutes walk). Shangri-la is also nearby which can be accessed going through SM first for a more convenient walk.  The 2-bedroom Executive has: - 1 king-size bed and another room has twin beds - 2 toilet and bath (the master's bedroom has a bathtub) - kitchenette (equipped with a stove and oven, microwave oven, huge refrigerator) with utensils good for at least 4 persons - living room - all rooms have TV with basic cable channels - washer/dryer - steam iron and board - adjustable a/c temp - free wi-fi; the account is limited to 4 gadgets; I think wired connection is available. - buffet"
378,January 2016,Perfect stay,NA,50," Imagine owning a luxury condominium unit, very spacious, with fully equipped kitchen, washing machine, king size bed, 3 flat screen tv with dvd players, free wifi internet, whole day air conditioning, daily housekeeping and add a fancy bathroom (for couple). Plus facilities like pool, small gym and businesses center and you only paid the number of night you stay isn't that perfect. Cause for me it was !!     Also the hotel is 10 to 15 min walk to several shopping mall (sm mega mall, podium, shangri la plaza) but it immediately surrounding is very quiet and peaceful at night.      PS: stay for 3 night dec 30 to jan 2, on a 1 bed room suite. We're able to get discount rate using a voucher, but am not sure what the regular room rate (i assume it must be more expensive on new years"
379,December 2015,Lovelier the second time around.....?,NA,40,"I came back this year for another two weeks of stay. Nice to know that the staff remembered me. I booked another one bedroom suite which included a buffet style breakfast for two for the duration of my stay (I'll get to this later). My issues last year were the soiled furniture and parking. This time my room is in a higher floor and while the furniture look tired (probably wasn't part of the soft renovation I was told from my previous review), they are clean and presentable. And I was given one parking spot, super convenient to be just nodded on by the parking attendant.   Jake at Reception is the same helpful, courteous and wonderful guy that even my friends commented on his demeanor. Thank you Jake! I requested Maggie from Housekeeping to take care of my room which I know is a"

381,December 2015,Excellent place to stay,NA,50,"I love come back to stay here... Excellent service. The rooms are comfortable, filled with warmth and feels at home. Location is convenient. Walking distance to Robinson and SM mall. Security is tight and I can never get enough of my room. Amenities in the room were excellent. The concierge would assist you in getting a taxi as well. I feel safe and secure staying here. Wifi was perfect "
382,March 2015,Really good hotel with good location.,NA,40,"I stayed here for meeting with some company on Ortigas ave. and ADB. This hotel front door was front of ADB gate. I can walk to there around 5min. Also when I was go to meeting place on Ortigas ave. It takes under 30min with traffic jam.  And the facilities quite modern and computable. If you have biz trip to Manila, it's good option to your accommodation.  P. S) Also few malls near here.  ADB게이트 바로 길 건너편에 있는 호텔입니다. 정확하게 레지던스에 가깝습니다. 매우 모던하고 깔끔하며 편안합니다. 비슷한 가격의 4, 5성호텔에 비해 경쟁력이 높아 추천합니다. ADB게이트 에서 오른쪽으로 가면 몰도 있어 스타벅스 커피숖을 이용하거나 식사를 하기도 좋으며 편의용품구매에도 용이합니다."
383,December 2015,Great Stay! Will be back for sure...,NA,50,"This place is JUST AWESOME! I have been here at least twice and did not disappoint. The staff is great, very friendly, very helpful, true to Filipino culture of great hospitality. The room is modern, large 1 bedroom, with nice kitchen, including a microwave, and washing machine. It is very clean, nice swimming pool and gym. The price is reasonable for a I would say a 4.5 star hotel. There is a lounge for drinks and restaurant including a buffet where you can have great dishes both local and foreign. There are several malls and lots of restaurants around for you to choose. It is about 15 km from MNL International Airport which will take you about an hour and a half during rush hours. Normally it should only be 30-40 minutes drive. If you are conducting business around Pasig area"
384,December 2015,Over and beyond guest service,NA,50,"The studio room was very spacious plus the shower has a built in steam. But what we liked the most is the service that the Oakwood team had provided us during the stay. They accommodated all of our requests, from extra chairs, ice, late checkout etc.. Would recommend staying here and I would love to go back again."
385,December 2015,quick getaway in the city,NA,50,"Not your usual hotel.  This is more like a efficiency hotel with large rooms, has a complete kitchenette for your cooking needs, plus a washer/dryer,  just perfect for relaxing long stays.  Their bathroom also has steam showers!"
386,November 2015,Never lets you down!,NA,50,"Oakwood Premier is absolutely one of my favorite hotels! Every time I arrive it is always a pleasant experience seeing the Front Office staff and entering my one-bedroom apartment. Jake in the Front Office is the bomb--always warm, helpful, and ready with a smile!The rooms are huge! And the furnishings make you feel at home and living in luxury at the same time. Every time my itinerary includes a trip to Manila (Ortigas in particular), I always choose Oakwood without a second thought."
387,April 2015,A very decent hotel...perfect for ADB visits !,NA,50,"I have stayed at this hotel a number of times this year.  They are a 5-star establishment with multiple entrances and excellent service.  On my first visit I was upgraded as part of a conference package and they treated me very well as part of a delegation. My second visit was also very good.  They originally gave me a more modest room but gave a discount on upgrades, something that is rare in Manila establishments.  I was very impressed.  Excellent service in the breakfast buffet and a solid balance between privacy and assistance when required make this ideal for any Asian development Bank meetings as the ADB Headquarters is across the road.  Many ADB consultants live/stay here as the rooms are self-contained.  One consultant I spoke even stays there for six months at a time!"
388,September 2015,Great hotel experience,NA,50,"Front desk service was consistently of a high standard - responsive and professional.   Rooms are spacious, new and plush. Also tastefully and interestingly decorated with wall prints.   Breakfast in the hotel restaurant provided a very large selection of quality food.   Location is in a quieter, commercial part of the city but still within walking distance to large shopping malls.   Given the horrendous Manila traffic the airport transfer was particularly worthwhile. The hotel arranges not just a driver but a hotel staff to meet you at the airport. The hotel subcontracts to Avis to provide drivers and cars. More expensive than local taxis but certainly more reliable. I ended up making use of their drivers the entire time I was there. "
389,December 2015,Big Spacious Room with Pools open til Late night,NA,50,"I stayed here for 2 days only. The hotel is located right at the front of ADB and nearby restaurants and place to shops.  The room is spacious with kitchen, washing machine, fridge, bathub, and TVs in each of the room (bathroom, bedroom, and livingroom).   The concept of renting out apartment is found here.. The pool opens til 10 pm and jacuzzi is also there. Gym is also open till 10pm."
390,December 2015,"Comfortable stay, big room, good location",NA,50,"We had a wonderful experience in Oakwood.  This was also the most affordable hotel we found in Ortigas during a December weekend.  We were able to book a one bedroom suite with full-kitchen and an in-room steam bath, for a very affordable price thanks to Agoda. Check-in time was at 3 pm which is later than most hotels even if the check-out time remained at 12 noon.  The deposit rate for the type of room we have was at PHP 4,000.  The concierge staff seemed okay but a bit stressed (not as friendly as we would have expected) but the security personnel were very accommodating.  The room was HUGE and the amenities were excellent (although we were not able to bake or use the dishwasher).  The pillows were unbelievably soft.  WiFi is free up to 4 people in the room.  We had an"
391,December 2015,"My fourth time since I first reviewed them. Better pool management, check-in was challenging, breakfast had issues.",NA,30,"We checked-in to 2 units for my daughter's birthday. Good thing I called ahead to check what time the rooms will be available. Normally, a standard hotel holds check-in at 2pm. Apparently, Oakwood check-in is at 3pm.   So, I went at 3pm and we were given our 1 br and 2 br without a hitch, or so I thought. Once I went to the floor of the 2 br unit, I immediately smelled cigarette smoke. We were placed in a smoking floor without prior consent. I had a toddler and an infant with me so that was unacceptable. When I called to complain, I was told the standard spiel of how they are running on full occupancy and they offered to clean the room. I told them the room was already clean and I can still smell smoke. I had to go down to ask them to give us another room. We were given on in"
392,November 2015,perfection,NA,50,"I was in Manila for a very short business trip, and was booked by my host at this hotel.  It was fantastic - lovely, clean and spacious rooms, my suite was over half the size of my NYC apartment!  A full kitchen, walk in closets with washer and dryer, all the amenities you could ever need.  Room service was available too and they also allow you to order out from area restaurants that deliver to the lobby.  All in all I highly recommend, excellent value for the price."
393,November 2015,room was nice and service was great,NA,50,Had a pleasant experience staying in Oakwood. Location is very convenient to nearby malls/restaurants although traffic can get quite bad. The amenities were great (plenty of gym equipment and a nice pool). The room was clean and quite big although the price can be a little expensive as compared to others.
394,November 2015,Overpriced and noisy,NA,30,"There a building in construction just at the bottom! Running night and day! No need for a kitchen wit a noisy fridge, no need for a TV in front of the toilet nor steam in your shower. Personal very friendly and helpful, high quality of the bed and sheets. No switch of light from your bed, frozen airco. I booked for two nights but accept my departure after one."
395,November 2015,"Really good room and facilities, but bad service",NA,40,"In hotel industry, the first and last impressions are the most important..so I got disappointed when the car door was not opened when I arrived (I waited for a few seconds before opening the door and no one opened it for me. Staff were just ignoring guests) Also, no one offered assistance for the bags, so I thought ""maybe they just don't do that here"" THEN I saw some staff helping the foreigners (I'm Filipino) with their bags and other stuff like pressing the elevator button.  The room is spacious and looks really nice. The fridge smelled so bad. The oven was not working, but we called someone to fix it, so that's good and thank you for that. There were a few mosquitoes so we called the front office who told us that she will call the  housekeeping to do something about it,but no"
396,November 2015,Simply Impeccable Service and Comfort,NA,50,"After the horrendous traffic during APEC week, I decided to give the family some rest and recreation with an overnight booking in Pasig's premiere hotel, Oakwood Joy Nostalg Hotel. I was able to request an early check in of 10am and we arrived around 10:30am. There was a slight hiccup since they could not find my booking. Apparently, they thought I was a woman and had the wrong name on their reservations. No worries. Check in was a bit longer than usual but nothing to fret about.   After having lunch at the nearby mall, my daughter and I enjoyed the warm jacuzzi and the lovely indoor pool. As usual, service was impeccable. The pool attendants were quick to provide towels. There were a lot of children and it was quite noisy but that's how kinds are. After swimming, I had a stint"
397,August 2015,Good hotel for Business Trip,NA,40,"We stayed here for 3 days and it's really a good hotel.   We had a 1-bedroom suite and it was a smoking room! Yey!   Staffs were nice, and the food was good! It's also in a good location and it's easy to get a cab anytime.   Conference room was okay.   Overall, it's a good one! :) "
398,November 2015,Excellent for a two week holiday,NA,50,"Excellent business hotel.Fully self contained rooms in various sizes,fully self contained kitchen,daily room service,nothing seemed to much trouble for staff.Great dining room,good food and service plus a relaxing bar that specialises in brands of malt whiskey. Indoor pool is large,great place for a morning swim and has under water music (only one in the world I was told).A fully equiped gym with trainers if required overlooks the pool.Area is a shoppers delight,there is a vast selection of malls to visit including S/M,Robinsons,The Podium,and Shangri-La Plaza all within walking distance.Greenhills market is a moderate walk away or a 200-300 peso taxi ride.I would not hesitate in returning to Oakwood in the future.Hotel does have views,not fantastic as surrounding area has a"
399,May 2015,Good choice in Ortigas area,NA,40,"Good location. Room was so spacious with complete amenities including kitchen utensils. Short walk to Podium. Love the tub!  Unfortunately no dishwashing soap, and the shower steam control panel is broken. Pool is smaller than in the pictures."
400,November 2015,Business woman's home away from home.,NA,50,"Disclaimer: This review is written from the perspective of a middle to upperclass (depending on what part of the world I'm in), white, American businesswoman traveling alone in Manila for the first time. Please adjust your expectations accordingly.  This is a brilliant place to stay if you are going to spend a lot of time in a hotel working or otherwise. The hotel's facilities will keep you entertained, from the DVD library in the business center, to the swimming pool and fitness center, to the cheerful dining room.   The food is good and reasonably priced (what in Manila isn't?). Service is extremely fancy. If you are used to middle class American hotels and service, you might feel uncomfortable with the attentiveness of the staff, the fanciness of the facilities. Or you may be"
401,October 2015,Great for long-stay,NA,40,"The rooms have a relatively large kitchen and wardrobe, washing machine is also available. Bed and couch are comfortable. But my best experience was the food (we ordered room service). The salmon soup was the best, I'm still craving for it.  The adobo ribs was quite good, too. Good thing we also had one spot for free parking, though it was in the 5th floor basement, it was still better than none."
402,October 2015,A blissfull nostalgic stay @ Oakwood Premier,NA,50,A perfect retreat for a family of 4. We made it our home base for pre wedding nd post wedd activities. A bonding moment also for our family before my daughter got married.   Booked a 2 Bedroom suite for 3 days 2 nights. Rooms were spotless and everything was in place. Beds were comfortable wt Tv on every room including the bathroom while u enjoy their bath tub. Wow this s the life.   Sala dining can have 15-20 people for cocktails.   Thank you for making our stay unforgettable and nostalgic.   Definitely a Must Try for families . locals and tourists.   Coming back sooonnnnn !
403,November 2015,Decent value for money,NA,40,"The room (actually an apartment) was very spacious and comfortable, but the construction site right next to the hotel was very disturbing. I guess it will be less so in the future once they are past the ground breaking which was a very noisy job and continued late to the night. But obviously one can't blame the hotel for that. The steam room in the bathroom was a joke as it didn't get hot at all (the device is tuned to not go beyond +50), but to compensate that, the sauna in the 6th floor was very good for a hotel sauna. But! The swimming pool is an indoor pool, so you can't enjoy the sun and the pool. I fail to understand what is the point of an indoor pool in Manila climate. Breakfast did perhaps not have as much choice as in other 5-star establishment, but nevertheless, all"
404,December 2014,Best hotel,NA,50,"I would just have to say that this is the best hotel in Manila for me, every time I'm here I'm so happy  The rooms are nice  The staff are friendly and very accommodating  Value for money is good  If I have to complain it's there parking they have slots that are so hard to get in and at times very limited"

I booked for One bedroom suite 2 nights since it can be both for fun and relaxation for him. Rooms are very spacious, with complete amenities especially kitchenette  super practical and convenient.   I love the room design, their steam bath , bed are very comfy which provided quality of sleep. All equipment and facilities are working no signs of damages and we never encountered malfunctions.  Super love their indoor no sunburn- tidy pool and of course their jacuzzi, which was more than a luxurious accessories coz of beneficial factors for Papa's health - reduce stress, improve"
406,October 2015,The unexpected,NA,40,"In one of my business trips last year, we encountered a problem with our hotel booking so we ended up here at OAKWOOD PREMIER JOY-NOSTALG, for which i was so so so grateful for one, its a very nice hotel, very posh if i may say. The room we had was a one bedroom type so there was a ample space for its kitchen and living room. I have been to these type of hotels but what sets it apart is its complete kitchen and laundry facilities. The room was so spacious, three flat screen tv's for the living, the bed room and the bath tub. The staff were so nice, the indoor pool and jacuzzi was really great. Haven't tried the gym though, I'm not the type of person who goes to the gym. The breakfast was indeed festive and its interior was so so nice, and you can see the ADB infront while eating"
407,October 2015,"We've already said this, but will say this again ""We love this hotel!""",NA,50,"We had always loved this hotel. But in our last visit, our check-in time was an hour of waiting. It wasnt even an early check in but maybe because it was a weekend? Good news is that Oakwood has redeemed itself with this recent stay.  Again, excellent service and clean, comfortable accommodations. We just love this hotel!"
408,October 2015,Excellent choice particularly for staying longer periods,NA,50,"The Hotel centrally located in Metro Manila offers one bed room suites with a Hall and Kitchenette. Spacious and well laid out, the Hotel makes for a great choice particularly those who may want to stay for greater periods. The Hotel has good food options also.  The service was efficient and warm."
409,October 2015,Great for Long Stays,NA,40,"I stayed here on business for a month. I had a one bedroom suite which was perfect. It had all the amenities I needed for being there for so long. Washer, coffee pot, full service kitchen. The beds are comfy with lots of closet space.   Everyone one of the staff members were always above and beyond friendly! They went out of their way to accommodate you and assist you with anything you needed,.   The breakfast buffet was great and it had a wide variety of foods, The staff there was the best and always remembered your name and what you drank. They were always so accommodating to our large group!"
410,September 2015,my daughter's choice,NA,40,"When we were planning where to stay for my daughter's birthday, the birthday girl insisted that we stay here. Well, its our third time to stay and honestly speaking, its a good choice. Ms. Princess and Ms Catherine from the reservation team is prompt in answering my emails. My daughter even had a complimentary cake. For three times staying here, I only am requesting one thing but it was never granted. We always stay for 2 nights, and i am requesting that maybe we could take the breakfast for one morning for a family of four instead of taking it for 2 mornings for 2 persons because we have an early flight. But they said they won't allow it. On our check out, they packed sandwiches and juice for us for not availing the breakfast. One more thing, on our last stay, the internet in"

Huge room with fully furnished like kitchen appliances where you can cook your meal. Awesome indoor swimming pool with controlled temperature. Gym is great and full of machines.
413,October 2015,anniversary to remember,NA,50,"we booked the one bedroom suite for our anniversary, best decision ever! we arrived and checked in early, we asked if we could have our room already. the front desk politely said that rooms were not yet available but once a room was availble she would just inform us. this is completely understandable because it was check out time. But i think they noticed that we have a toddler and gave us a room immediately. we just waited for like 45minutes. the front desk suggested we could stay in the hotel's playroom located at the 5th floor while waiting. staff is very polite and very prompt with our requests. i requested for a non smoking floor and a lower floor. and check out is a breeze! i couldn't ask for a better experience! two thumbs up oakwood! "
414,October 2015,Great value for money!,NA,50,"Walking distance to SM Megamall. Very peaceful despite the business district location. Great value for money, 1 bedroom suite is a good deal compared to other hotel's 1 bedroom suite. The furniture shows elegance and modernity. Breakfast is good too. Will definitely be back!"
415,September 2015,Good hotel in Pasig,NA,40,"Great room - love it! Amazing room , spacious - great fittings.  Gym - so so.  Not enough machines/equipment when it comes to weight training Pool - nice, indoor , heated! Food - ala carte menu okay, not worth the price for most dishes Bar - great whiskey selection, but they allow smoking"
416,July 2015,Great stay,NA,50,"* Location is okay. It's in the Ortigas business district and walking distance from the malls such as Podium, SM Megamall, and Robinson's Galleria. It's in front of the Asian Development Bank compound  * The room was lovely, clean, spacious, and cozy. We stayed in a room with a bar, kitchen, living room, and a bedroom with a huge bathroom  Overall a great stay!"
417,September 2015,"Away from home, but still at home!!!",NA,50,"Oakwood is one of the best places I have stayed at while traveling for business. You just can't get enough of the comfort this place has to offer.  I was staying in a Studio with a small kitchen. I must stress that inspite of the kitchen therein, space wasn't compromised. There was lodes of it. The room was super comfortable and had everything that one needs. It was loaded with the basic one needs. If you plan to cook, then you have the option to order what you need from the hotel itself but at an additional price, but not that much.  The washroom has an in - built steam which is a plus point as you can relax in the room itself. Loved it!!!   if you are staying for a longer duration, the you don't have to worry about laundry as there's a washer / dryer in  the room. You are"
418,September 2015,Very nice hotel for everyone,NA,50,I have booked this hotel for the surprise celebration of the birthday of my grandmother. I booked a 2 bedroom suite and it was really awesome. Flying from Dubai to Manila I went straight to the hotel and immeditely fell in love with it. The living room and the dining area is very spacious and would fut even a party of 30 people. The rooms are massive aswell and the washroom is to die for. The kitchen is fully equiped and is very organized. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wanted to have a great time while in Manila.
419,September 2015,Excellent Accommodation,NA,40,"For our last three days in Manila, we decided to treat ourselves to a five star 970 sf one bedroom suite. We definitely were not disappointed with our unit on the 18th floor. Very clean and well maintained complete with washer/dryer, dishwasher, full size fridge, steam shower, free standing bathtub with TV, TV/DVD in bedroom and living room (full TV channel selection), safe, iron and ironing board, separate temperature controls in each room. The windows are thermopane keeping the unit cool. We were able to sleep comfortably with the air cond. turned off. Very relaxing like home. Massages are reasonable and can be had in the Paradasia Spa (off the pool on 6th floor) or in you room for a small extra cost. There's an indoor 60 ft lap pool (bat. 4.5 ft deep) and large jacuzzi.

420,September 2015,As good as home,NA,50,"After many years of trial and error in the Manila area I finally found a place that made me feeling like home. The breakfast room and particular the way they managing it is out standing , places like the one in Eastwood or inGlobal City should send their staff here to learn of how it is done. They have  nice gym and pool. The housekeeping service is very good I was in room 1005 and my house keeper was on top of everything, just perfect. The staff in general is very attentive and dealing with your issues immediately. You don't hear like at many other places, ""your concern has been noticed and we will pass it on"" there was only one small down side the smell that was coming from the open drain under the washing machine. They dealt with it immediately but it come back quickly. I"
421,August 2015,Best for Relaxation.... Feels like home :),NA,40,"I've searched for the best hotel in Ortigas Pasig and this came up at #1 by that time,  I've stayed on a 1-bedroom apartment on the whole month of August and I have no regrets.  The room was huge that can accommodate my family members when they want to visit me and relax.  There is TV on the living room and the bedroom.   Bathroom has tv, 2 sinks, bathtub and steam bath except no bidet.  Comfortable sofa and and the king size bed was very soft.  Nina the housekeeper was very helpful and nice and would always ask me if there is anything needed.  The indoor swimming pool is nice and the jacuzi as well.  The breakfast buffet at the restaurant was great and the staff was nice including Roslyn.  The gym was huge and they have towels and water dispenser and wet tissues provided.  7F"
422,September 2015,Second Home when I'm in Manila..,NA,50,"I stayed here for 3 nights during my most recent stay on September 2015. We were a family of 4. My reservation was for a 2-Bedroom Suite but I was upgraded to a 3-Bedroom Suite due to unavailability of the 2-Bedroom. Although the upgrade was a welcome surprise, the only down side was that we were given a smoking room. Which, initially, concerned me a LOT since every member of my family is asthmatic. But since we checked-in at 1:00AM, I was too exhausted to complain. I decided to just check out the room and complain the next morning should the ""smell"" be intolerable. Fortunately, there was no sign or smell of cigarette in the entire unit.  In my honest opinion, the 3-Bedroom Suite seems to be not as well-maintained compared to the Studio, 1-Bedroom and 2-Bedroom suites I stayed"
423,July 2015,A home away from home,NA,40,"My family and I stayed in a 2-bedroom executive apartment last July, 2015. The apartments were spacious and very clean. We booked for 3 nights. My kids liked the pool. They wished we have more days to enjoy the other amenities; and so did my husband and I. The room service was good. The hotel personnel were respectful. The male receptionist was courteous and patient while I was trying to access the internet from my laptop to forward him my hotel reservation. In the end, I had to use my cp because the wifi connection was slow. It was not what I anticipated. I was hoping to see beautifully arranged fresh flowers in sight that would welcome my eyes every time I entered the lobby. It would have been a very refreshing sight. If there was, I hardly noticed it because it may not be"
424,December 2014,Great Accomodation,NA,40,"We booked the hotel for our Christmas getaway, it was just me, my mom and my older sister. The moment we walked in we were all amazed on how big the place is, even so the bedroom. My mom automatically occupied the bedroom and I can see in her that she really feels relaxed. The interiors was okay and the sofas in the living room are all comfy. The tvs were huge, both in the living room and the bedroom. The bathroom was clean and everything you need are already provided, except for the bidet,but there's a tv in the bathroom. Towels and bathrobe were clean and soft. There's a fully equiped kitchen but we were not able to use it. The breakfast buffet was okay, nothing special for me but I felt full because there were a lot of choices. We were not able to use the heated pool but it's"
425,July 2015,Comfort at its bedt,NA,50,This is the second time i have stayed at the Oakwood in the one bedroom apartment and it has been fantastic both times. The rooms are large clean and comfortable. The hotel resturant is beautiful. The food is first class and tasty. The bar menu is also good and the room service menu is extensive. All the staff are pleasant and lovely and can not do enough for you. Highly recommend as somewhere to stay not just for business but also for pleasure. I won't stay anywhere else when in Manila
426,May 2015,Top notch service,NA,50,Service apartment at its best in this part of the city. Breakfast buffet was top notch. The one bedroom suite was able to accommodate our whole family with lots of room to spare. Highly recommended to families looking for a place to spend a staycation in the metro 
427,August 2015,Truly Great Experience ,NA,50,"Checked in 3rd Aug for studio type room for 5 nights.  Room was nice size with everything - full kitchen, sofa and even a washer/dryer. I must say - very practical and location great - very near to the malls.  I called guest services with very minor issues with the room and they were on the case straight away to resolve and I must say, Mr. Sonny really looked after me to make my stay as comfortable as possible. He dealt with the situation very professionally whilst keeping the guest needs and comfort as priority.  I ended up getting an upgrade to 1 bedroom room and this was luxury at its best. Enormous space with a look / finish (inc. fixtures & fittings) that I can only describe as ""grand"" and made you feel like a king. It was surly like staying in a luxury apartment.   Indoor"
428,July 2015,A home away from home :),NA,40,"It has been our third time to stay in this hotel. We were able to try staying at their studio room, one-bedroom and two-bedroom suite, and were equally satisfied with each of said accomodation. It is situated fairly close to the mall (Robinsons Galleria), which was just a short walk away.   In-room facilities were outstanding. Anything you might possibly need, you can find in the room. Very smart use of space, you will never feel like the room is closing in on you.   However, I would have to make a side comment on the person in-charge at the front desk. I do not remember her name anymore, but she has miserably failed to meet the high standard of service that I have expected from this hotel, that I found the need to point this shortcoming out on this review. She had us waiting in"
429,August 2015,Pleasantly surprised,NA,40,"Stayed at a 1 bedroom for an overnight staycation. Check in was quick. The room was spacious and easily fit my entire family when they came over, with room for kids to play. Did not use the kitchen for cooking but it had utensils, pots, and even serving dishes. Everything was clean. Bathroom was nice and big too. The bed was confortable. Room temperature remained consistent. Will stay here again. "
430,July 2015,Best Hotel stay ever,NA,50,"My wife and I have travelled a fair bit and have stayed at countless hotels. Never have I felt so compelled to become a Tripadvisor member so that I can share my experience. This is without a doubt the most exceptional hotel stay I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Sonny and the staff at the Oakwood Premier were exceptional in their level of service. Don't get me wrong, they weren't 'over the top', they were just perfect. The room was very well presented and as clean as new. The beds were comfortable, the lounge was relaxing, the whole place was well laid out. This was within walking distance to the major shopping malls in Manila. My 3 year old daughter fell ill whilst we were in Manila (dodgy waffle from the shopping mall). The inhouse nurse was very prompt in her"
431,June 2015,First Impressions,NA,40,"It was a good first impression but I wasn't really in awe of the property.  The plus side are the rooms.  I stayed at a 1 bedroom apartment and I loved it.  It was huge and clean as shown in my photos.  We had dinner at Nostalgia and I enjoyed the food there.  The lady who works at the restaurant (she is the duty manager if I am not mistaken) was very helpful and attentive.  She gave her recommendations on what to sample and I was very pleased with the choices.  The wait staff are also well trained and polite.  They also offered complimentary dessert which was a nice gesture.  Breakfast is okay, not too many options but the food is good enough.  Funny though that in the 2 mornings I visited, the cereal dispenser was broken at both times.  The not so great side... the staff"
432,November 2014,Better than you'd think,NA,40,"I've stayed here for business a few times in the past year simply because it's close to our Manila office.  If I didn't need to stay in this area, I probably wouldn't stay here.  But when I have, it's actually been very good.  It looks a bit old-hat and b-grade from the outside and even the foyer, but the rooms are huge, very comfortable and nicely done.  And the breakfast and service good.  Plus there is some decent dining near-by.  It's not a top luxury hotel but nor is it trying to be.  For what it is for business, I've really liked it.  More than does the job."
433,July 2015,the best fully serviced apartment in pasig,NA,50,"A walk thru metal detector & security personnel with` canine are the entrance.  i arrived at the property at 1130.  showing my AGODA voucher thru my ipad..  front desk staff Nena was friendly, helpful & professional.  check in was fast.

434,June 2015,Great accommodation and service,NA,50,"The overall stay experience is great.  The staff and service is friendly but professional and no request is too much trouble.  The room is 5 star, very modern and practical.  Internet is fast.  The breakfast is a good variety of western and local food and plenty of it.  The staff in the restaurant are very efficient and friendly.  I would recommend this hotel highly and would always stay here if I visit again.  Its like a home away from home.  The pool and gym are great."
435,July 2015,Best service we've ever experienced in a hotel.,NA,50,"We had a wonderful stay. The hotel, besides being luxuriously appointed, provided us and our family with the best service we have experienced in any hotel around the world. A big thank you to Sonny for his special attention and service. Having said that, all of the  staff from the front counter to the porter to the waiting staff in the restaurant are fantastic.  Beyond the basics, our relatives had a sick child who had to go to hospital and the hotel really showed what great service and care is all about.  Well done to all the staff in providing such a high standard hotel."
436,June 2015,Oakwood....A perfect place for weekend getway,NA,50,"Before the start of classes, my wife and I decided to bond with our 2 children. And I must say that Oakwood is a perfect place for a weekend getaway. We were given a corner 1Bedroom Suite, very spacious for a family of 4. My wife loves the kitchen (though we only manage to use the microwave and coffee maker). My kids spent almost the whole day in the pool area. Apart from the first class facilities, what made our stay special is the warm greetings from the staff at the lobby and in the restaurant. We felt at home during our stay at here and we will definitely be back."
437,July 2015,Will Always Be Our Second Home,NA,50,"I love everything about Oakwood. I love the room, the service and everything! Will get the membership! Thanks and see you again very soon!   Checked in last July 17-18th of 2015 Stayed at 1 bedroom suite Kitchen is impressive TIP: if planning to cook inside, buy your needs at the grocery stores nearby. Oakwood have list of groceries but very expensive.  "
438,June 2015,My Only Choice.,NA,50,"Ive been celebrating my birthday here for the past three years and nothing has changed since then. It only gets better and better. Thats why I highly recommend this service apartment to friends and relatives who frequently visit Manila or those who'd love to pamper themselves after a long, tiring and stressful week at work or if they just want to splurge and have a relaxing weekend with their friends or loved ones.   The place is also strategically located near high end malls and restos you can go to anytime if you feel like shopping or eating although they already have a variety of foods that you can readily order  from their wide array of menus.   Their food tastes heavenly as always and their staff always have a ready smile and provide excellent customer experience.   "
439,November 2014,amazing amenities,NA,50,"Attended a conference and was billeted in this property. I stayed in the 'smallest' room category called studio but it was not small at all. There's a kitchen, living room space, huge comfortable bed, even a small office nook at the back with a washer - dryer (I was surprised that they offer this even in their standard room). I called the front desk to ask if they have a room with a tub (mine had none), but it was sold out. they then informed me that my shower is also a steambath! I tried it after a long day at the conference and it was  completely relaxing.  Just had a bit of problem with housekeeping and cleaning of the rooms regularly. but other than that, I have no complaints."
440,June 2015,Value for money! This was a surprise!,NA,50,My wife and I attended a wedding last June 20 and the preparations were held in Oakwood. We booked their one room suite with their weekend promo rate - it was a steal! It was as big as the first floor of our resthouse in batangas! it was wonderfully decked out as well with high end furnishings. we are excited to go back.
441,June 2015,Truly five star,NA,50,"I have been staying in several hotels in Ortigas, and I could say that Oakwood by far is the best place to be.  it may not be as grand like its neighboring hotels, but you can feel the warmth and comfort that you are looking for when you are away from home! Best value... Great location"
442,July 2015,"Our second home - superb staff, excellent service",NA,50,"I decided to add another review of Oakwood to highlight 2 things: first -the excellent service of the reservations (Jobelle, princess and team); the front desk team (Nina and team) and literally all of the hotel staff; Second- the gym and pool facilities. Every time we go home for our annual home leave - we stay at the Oakwood. If you have a big family who want to get together for dinner this is the best alternative to dining out. We booked 3 rooms and basically ordered food in. Stress-free get together with friends and family. We also managed to enjoy the gym with first class Life Fitness equipment, complete weights and a spacious area for yoga, Pilates and core exercises. They even have a bosu ball! The pool has underwater music, a small whirlpool and a clean and well"
443,June 2015,Old Glamour,NA,50,"The Oakwood Premier apartments are more richly furnished and welcoming. I recall being in one a few years back of the same design. They were kept looking new! There was a small pull out table for my tea mug and snacks, which can be situated nearer as I cozily sprawled on the sofa watching TV. There was another soft chair for reading both at the receiving room and bedroom. The bath area was somewhat revealing with the huge glass window and mirrors. There is blinds you can hide in Hehehe their fitness center is well equipt and the pool is more for serious swimming. Going down to Nostalgia brings one to another world! It builds as one walks the corridor leading there. It is the most unique dinning room I've seen in Philippine hotels. Quite fitting for the various foreign guests I"
444,June 2015,Great Place to stay,NA,40,I have stayed at the Oakwood 3 times now but this is my first time writing a review.   I stay in a 1 bedroom apartment which is really good. Very spacious. Has a kitchen where you can cook your own food. Bathroom is huge and the bath is amazing.   The room service and restaurant is beautiful and most of the time I eat there.   Staff are friendly and will do anything for you.   It's also in a great spot being walking distance to 3 malls. One of them being the mega mall.   Will stay here again.
445,June 2015,Second Review,NA,50,"Spent a post-birthday weekend last June 20th here and brought some friends along, just for dinner. Again, i wasn't wrong in choosing this place. Check in and out was a breeze, and as always, the room we were in had the things we needed. From preparation of the meals, to dining, to washing the dishes, and an intimate cocktail after.   My friends also couldn't stop taking selfies because of the perfect mood set by the fine-looking room! :) One of them even (immediately) scheduled another stay this July!   See you soon again, Oakwood.  Cheers!"
446,June 2015,Business in Manilla,NA,50,"The purpose of my trip was a business trip to meet with people at the Asian Development Bank(ADB). This hotel is ideally located with a link to the road adjacent tothe ADB. The hotel link brings you opposite the visitors entrance to the ADB. The room was clean and spacious with a living room, kitchen including washing machine and a separate bed rroom. I entertained a coleague from the states in the restaurant which I found very good. I did not use the pool but it looked very good. I would recommend this hotel especially anyone wishing to visit the ADB."
447,June 2015,Great for Family staycation,NA,40,"Our family stayed for 2 nights at the 2 bedroom suite. They have a big bathroom with shower, bathtub (which my niece enjoyed) and a big TV (which I enjoyed). The room is so big that my niece can't stop jumping and running around the whole room. It smelled of cigarette smoke from the hallway to our room and when we complained at the front desk, we were told that the whole floor is in fact a smoking level, but all occupants ""daw"" are non smokers. We asked them to spray air freshener or something because we have a child with us. When we return that night the smell from the hallway is distinctly lessened and they even placed an ionizer in our room.   The table is big and can fit 6 people, more if you add the chairs from the living room and bed rooms. Kitchen is well equipped (stove,"
448,July 2014,Like a second home,NA,50,"This is my absolute, favourite hotel in Metro Manila. I stayed here several times and each stay is worth the experience!  This hotel is the epitome of luxury. The rooms are more of a condo unit than an actual hotel room. For their one bedroom suite, they have a spacious living room, dining area and kitchen. The kitchen is fairly complete in equipment and a washing machine is also placed their and the living room has a comfortable sofa that can be slept in and a high end television. There is a separate bedroom with a huge bed, study table and another LED TV. They have one of the best bathrooms, spacious, a luxurious tub with a TV attached and a large shower room.   My favourite experience here however, is when we checked in at their three bedroom suite. The  suite has three"
449,June 2015,One of the best hotels ,NA,50,"My siblings and I stayed overnight in a 1-bedroom suite for my sisters wedding preparation. They have a big bathroom with tv in front of the tub, but just basic toiletries (no branded facial moisturizers, wash, toner set), and no bidet. The kitchen is fully furnished, complete with utensils, oven, dishwasher, microwave, etc... and washing machine (so much better than other hotels with 1-bedroom suite).   Great view, great food, great in-room service from their own spa, most especially great service from all hotel staff. Highly recommended :)"
450,December 2014,Whew,NA,40,"More expensive than the average upscale hotel rooms but hey you got a functioning house so to say. Big room big CR big sala. We cooked most of our meals there, encouraged by the dishwasher right under the sink. The staff is very courteous. Two big malls are both of walking distance. More expensive than discovery suites but bigger and better parking."
451,September 2014,Felt like a princess when I stayed!,NA,50,"We have invited by our Singaporean colleague to have a girl's bonding during her stay here in Manila. Ourcompany booked her to in Oakwood, I really fell in love with this hotel.. The room that we stayed in is very princess like :) .. There's a small kitchen with very modern cooking equipments. There's a whole body mirror, the bed is lovely, soft and very big! There's a washing machine with dryer. The location has a great proximity to the malls and restaurants. I just love everything in this place from the hotel interiors up to the great service provided bynthe staffs,"
452,June 2015,Living the suite life; weekender,NA,50,"For those who don't have the time to travel, stay-cation is the closest we can get to destressing. From the crisp white sheets , bath tub, complete home theater, bluetooth speakers, complete kitchen, dining room, living room. To the indoor pool and jacuzzi. 5/5. Definitely coming back. "
453,June 2015,Great great great room !,NA,50,I had my rent car here.. The location was a bit far from airport.. Like 45-60 minutes include the trafiic jam !  Check in was going so smooth... I had 2BR apartments and i was so stunned by it !! The room was big and luxury... With 3 TVs with a bunch of channel... Great wifi.. Great amenities... Also have a full set cutlerries and coffee machine... Just a little walk from mall and food !! Superb !! And free parking also...
454,June 2015,great stay,NA,50,"first time staying here when we visited manila and we had an excellent time!we stayed on a one bedroom suite,so spacious,complete kitchennete,beautiful living room and the bedroom is amazing with a very spacious bathroom...wish we stayed longer"
455,July 2014,Favorite place in ortigas,NA,50,"My favorite place to stay in Ortigas! We just Keep coming back for more. Front desk is always efficient and friendly. Rooms are spacious, clean and well-appointed. Ample cooking and dining utensils in the kitchen. Beds are big and comfortable. Spacious living and dining areas. Love watching tv from the bathtub and having the personal sauna in the shower. Lap pool is crystal clear and always has water at the right temperature (is it just me or is that saltwater?) and relaxing underwater music too. Like the fact that the pool attendants politely but firmly enforce rules on proper attire, decorum and number of persons allowable per room in the pool (once a large boisterous group swam in the pool; just when inward considering either complaining or taking my kids out of the pool, the"
456,June 2015,Took the time off,NA,50,We could not get our baby swim in other pools.. but when we let her try their jacuzzi.. she was so fond of it.. we knew she'll love their heated pool as well. We had a great stay since we booked for a studio type but when we checked in we were upgrade to their one bedroom suite.. we were satisfied with their service as well.. 
457,November 2014,Not upto our expectations of a service apartment,NA,30,"Nothing great about this place, except that its close to SM Megamall. The rooms were clean but the kitchen was lacking in utensils for cooking. we had to call the reception to request for utensils.  We were not very impressed with the service and almost everything is at extra cost like laundry washing powder or dish washing liquid. Complimentary Wifi was was only available at the lobby. There was an indoor swimming pool, but it closes by 10pm. I'm sure there are other service apartments in Manila which offer a better service for the same price."
458,May 2015,2nd Time @ Oakwood,NA,40,"We had a great time on our first visit at Oakwood so we decided to stay again. Still received great service. Arrived at 8am but the receptionist said they are full thats why no more available at the moment. They stored our luggage as we stroll to the nearby malls. At 12nn, i received a call from Ms. Charlyn informing me that we already have a room so we went back and rest. The same awesome room we had last December. We cooked our meals in the kitchen for 3 days so we saved a lot. Breakfast was included in the package but sad to say the variety is limited. This time, we tried the pool. I love the jacuzzi but my kids are complaining for the strong chlorine. Towels at the pool are old and worn out. A five star hotel should have the best towels. For me, the highlight of this hotel"
459,January 2015,"Comfortable Rooms, Relaxing Ambiance",NA,40,"Upon arrival, our room was not available at the time, at first, we decided to walk to the nearby malls (Malls like SM Megamall and The Podium are quite near). But once we came back the staff offered us a temporary room, where we stayed for a few hours, even rested in, with no extra charge, which was awesome of them. Their rooms are very big, they have, if not all, most of the necessities you need for cooking. The bathrooms were very, very nice, with a TV next to your tub. The rooms were clean, had great air-conditioning, and the service was fast. One downside though, we found a piece of Lingerie belonging to an unknown woman in one of the cabinets, I don't know how the room service could not have missed that. But. Other than that, the rooms, our stay, All very good."
460,May 2015,Service With A Smile,NA,50,"Arriving at the Hotel for a two night stay was a little daunting, having my bags searched and gone over by sniffer bomb dog, but I guess it's the norm theses days. The check-in staff were very friendly and very efficient, we were up in our room in no time. Travelling in a group of four and it was late so we decide to eat in the bar and have a few drinks, my partner stays here quite often on business, but hasn't stayed here for a couple of months, but as soon as the barman saw her, he called her by name and asked if she wanted her usual drink, which he named, not only by liquor type, but also by brand name, very impressive indeed. Breakfast was provided and was extensive and delicious. Room size is very good and linen is clean and fresh."
461,May 2015,It feels like home,NA,50,"Me and my family stayed here last month May 1 and so far we really enjoyed it. It was so comfortable and all things you needed when your far away from your home are already here like stove, kitchen supplies, washing machine.etc. i love the jacuzzi but i wished it can be more bigger. They are very strict on your swimming attire. The only thing i was quite disappointed here is when we arrived there we enter at the back of the hotel. we have so many luggage and my mom is disabled but the attendant which i think is a valet said that the bell man is in the main entrance so he's saying he cant help us bring our things to lobby which i think is so discriminating. But still i will probably go back here again. Thumbs up to the bartender who made my favorite margarita :)"
462,May 2015,Great for Long Stay,NA,40,I had an overnight stay at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed it.  Excellent front desk and reception although the lobby had a weird flow (feng shui) due to all the security. The elevators could be faster but i wasn't really in a hurry.   One of the best smoking lounges.  Service was quiet and efficient and exhaust system was very good.   The best smelling smoking floor corridor i have ever been to.  So if you are a smoker like me...you will appreciate this comment.  The room was very clean and airconditioner and lights were on upon my entry.  Very good ambiance.  Bathroom was clean but towels are already on the way to shabby .  All toiletries were complete.   Kitchen was complete and well organized. Bed and linens were in good state. Pillows are
463,May 2015,Staycations,NA,50,"My friend once invited me to this hotel during her birthday party. She stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and I was so impressed, since then I never stayed in any hotel. Me and my family loves this home away from home hotel. The rooms are so spacious, great bathrooms, tv's and docks are the best and the interiors, bed and sofas are so cozy that makes us not want to go home anymore. The staffs are so courteous and very accommodating, they respond fast to your every need. The rooms is an apartment type with a complete kitchen facility, washer and dryer and a big ref (not like in other hotels that has a small personal reference tucked inside a closet). I assure you that if you just want to relax and take a break stay at Oakwood Premier. "
464,May 2015,Excellent One Night Stay!!!,NA,50,"My Wife and I had a great stay here.  We were upgraded to 1-bedroom deluxe.  We were amazed of the room compared to other 5 star hotel here in manila.  The downside - AC unit is defective, no welcome drinks/fruits, breakfast somehow good but not great, it's our wedding anniv and we thought we'll have special present but none,.  Overall, our stay will be memorable and better than other hotels we've had stayed on here in Manila.  the best so far."
465,July 2014,Perfectly comfortable,NA,40,"The rooms are fitted in typical modern style (think beige and wenge) and are wonderfully comfortable. The staff are quiet, discreet and polite. A great hotel for me but maybe not for those seeking a more celebrity-oriented Vegas-like experience."
466,May 2015,"Excellent service, clean and the best WiFi",NA,50,Excellent and courteous service from the front desk to room service. TheWiFi is excellent and never drops out. Rooms are very well maintained and has decent amenities to suit an extended stay. Food offering at the buffet breakfast is so so but the staff are very attentive. A mini bar would be really nice as would be better I room coffee/tea options. 
467,March 2015,at the front of ADB,NA,40,"this is hotel is rather famous for the resident people, but also very convenient for the travelers who visits the Asian Development Bank. Several sized rooms are available up to you needs. I like the breakfast here, where they offer fresh fruits."
468,March 2015,Luxurious and spacious,NA,50,"I stayed at Oakwood for a business trip and our rooms were all upgraded. The rooms were huge with a separate living room and large closets. It was clean and luxurious, with comfortable furniture, large bed, even a TV above the bathtub. After our meetings I couldn't think of a better place to relax.  The buffet breakfasts had a good variety and were delicious. The staff were helpful and it wasn't difficult to get a taxi."
469,June 2014,"Oakwood, best serviced hotel ever!",NA,50,"We booked a 2bedroom suite and 1 bedroom suite in Oakwood last January 2014 for our wedding.   1. Rooms- The rooms are clean and very spacious. Each room is well-lit, complete with appliances you may need during your stay.  2. Service- Excellent service. Our requests were granted, hassle-free.  3. Rates- Very reasonable. You get more than what you pay for.  Highly recommended."
470,April 2015,Probably our new favorite hotel in Manila.,NA,50,"We've stayed for 4D/3Nights. Everything is well maintained. Quite delighted to see there's a washing machine we could use as we are traveling back to Doha. A big sigh on my part.   ROOM.  Stayed in RM 1710. Room is huge, and clean. No issues or whatsoever. There's a kitchen with complete kitchen utensils you would love to use. A dining table is also provided. And a comfy living room.  FOOD.   Food is exceptional. Everyday they have a different variety of food to choose from. I am well pleased on this part. Restaurant has a good ambiance not too crowded.   STAFFS.  Staffs are all polite and friendly. Kudos to the management you have well-trained staffs.  Definitely coming back. My family had a wonderful experience."
471,October 2014,Favorite Hotel for Staycation,NA,40,We have been celebrating October birthdays here. I have always experienced quick check in and check out. I love their hair conditioner. The fully functional kitchen and laundry amenities will also help you save money.
472,April 2015,fine long term hotel/apartment,NA,40,"stayed in the Oakwood for 2 weeks with colleagues.  My room was well appointed and confortable.  Best part was the home theater speaker - I hooked my ipod to it and rocked the house!!  Also the maid service that cleaned up after I cooked.  Other colleages took a suite and we worked during the day there.  Two issues: the wifi was sometimes hard to connect to, and the water temperature in the swimming pool was on the warm side for laps (I mean, it's so hot in Manila, who needs hot pool water?).  Staff is incrediably polite.  Breakfast was on the better side - full complement of eastern and western foods.  I rotated between eggs, dim sum, granola, and bagels just to keep it fresh.  Location is so-so - walking most places in Manila is a chore."
473,March 2015,Perfect Staycation!,NA,50,It was my first time staying at this hotel and it is for my nephew's surprise Graduation party. Little did I know that I'd be surprised with how clean and fully equipped hotel it is. Loved the bathroom especially the bath tub; I could even sleep on it.
474,April 2015,Indeed a home away from home!,NA,50,"I just checked out today, and my family is still hyped by our recent staycation. The rooms are spacious perfect for families and the location is just perfectly located near malls. We loved the indoor pool as well as the gym. Definitely coming back! Special thanks for the excellent service of Lala from Front Desk as well as Princess of Reservations. Always ready to anticipate your guest's needs. See you all again soon!"
475,April 2015,Great serviced apartments,NA,50,"Admittedly, any review is subjective, and there are some odd things in this place that make you wonder whether you would be better off somewhere else.  The slow check-in and check-out procedures could be improved, and certainly they should revise the pricing policy of the in-house laundry service – the steep prices are not coherent with a hotel that caters for long stays.  And frankly I cannot believe that they would charge you extra money if you want an espresso coffee rather than ordinary coffee with your breakfast.  Certainly unacceptable in a 5 stars hotel. But, in spite of all that, in this property I had a wonderful two-week stay.  The location of this place – just opposite the Asian Development Bank and very close to the Mega Mall and the Robinson Mall – could not be"
476,April 2015,Great hotel providing fully equiped appartments.,NA,40,"Stayed here for business. Great hotel with true Filipino hospitality, great service and fantastic rooms. I was staying in the 21st floor and had a suite with bedroom, bathroom, lounge and fully equipped kitchen. Room very well appointed, clean and tidy."
477,May 2014,Looking forward to coming back!,NA,50,"Stayed here twice before, and planning on doing so again really soon, and we're looking forward to it!  My young one considers this her home in Manila. Every time she's been for a visit, this is where we stay.  The staff makes her feel special, where ever she goes in the hotel.  I think she'd give them all the stars.  The lobby staff is always happy to see us and eager to help us with whatever we need.  They even remembered us from our previous stay, a couple of years prior.  The restaurant staff is so solicitous.  They know my family, greet us and show us to where the rest of the family is seated, and have LO's favorites ready to go (juice or milk).  Someone saw me eying an empty egg dish, and without me asking, brought some to my table when the new batch came out.  The room"
478,April 2015,Had a long business stay,NA,40,"Stayed in the hotel for 40 days as a part of my business trip. Good ambience, great service and helpful staff. Its overall a great pleasant stay. Recommended. They  take care of your weekend entertainment as well with movies and drinks. Overall a nice place to check in and recommended for a nice stay."
479,April 2015,What a Disappointment,NA,30,"We were encouraged by the almost unanimous positive reviews for this hotel along with their ability to accommodate our large family. Unfortunately, our stay at the hotel was very disappointing.  First the positives: They accommodated our large family of 14, at a price.  It is located an easy walk from Robinson's mall where you can find just about anything that you need.  The food was very good. The breakfast buffet had a large selection of multi-cultural foods from the Philippines, India and the US. We ordered room service a few times including several of the large platters of Filipino food that were all very well prepared.  The rooms are spacious with big closets and our initial impressions were positive.  The children's play area, actually a big room, provided a place for 8"
480,March 2015,5 stars,NA,50,"I booked this hotel for a special occasion. Excellent location, spotless, huge apartment style rooms, breathtaking views, excellent facilities, so comfy beds, very good selection for breakfast, this is a bargain for what you pay!"
481,March 2015,Secure and Affordable,NA,50,"Our group was housed at Oakwood for a wedding.  They were serious with the security of their guests-there are guards with sniff-dogs at the entrance.  Everyone must go through a security check (ala-US airports).  The free breakfast was excellent with lots of hot/cold dish/choices, fruits, juices, coffee/tea, and a well-stocked dessert table.  Accommodations range from studios/two-three bedrooms with kitchenettes & laundry facilities.  Clean and comfy place to stay while in Manila/Pasig."
482,April 2015,Amazing experience,NA,50,"We stayed overnight at a one bedroom suite, it was just a surprise birthday gift of my brother to our dearest mother. The room is spacious, smells good and clean. I love every part of the room especially the kitchen. The staff are kind and courteous. The amenities are great especially the swimming pool and the jacuzzi area. We had given a complimentary massage and we enjoyed it. I hope we can have an opportunity again to have a vacation in your hotel. One word I can describe the hotel is ""AWESOME"". :D"
483,March 2015,Another Great Stay,NA,50,"I headed back to Oakwood for another business trip this past month.  They continued to show why I prefer to stay at this hotel during my trips.  My last trip, my company had me stay at Edsa Shangrila.  While nice, the staff and size make Oakwood my preferred hotel.  The staff knows me by name, welcomes me back to Manila and attentive to any needs I may have.  Rooms are clean and the cleaning staff will work with your schedule for touch ups, daily/weekly/bi-weekly.  Oakwood has a wonderful breakfast buffet with changing main courses daily.  Location is great and near to anything you may need.  It also serves as a good launching point to anywhere in the city or day trips outside the metro Manila area."
484,March 2015,Great apartments for long term stays...poor restaurant,NA,30,"Stayed for about 2 weeks and really enjoyed the apartment suites.  They are spacious and has just about everything you need.  They will even go out and get groceries for you  which you may want to consider after a few trips to the restaurant.  I think they must cater to 2-3 day stays but within one week it was easy to tell that they were just recycling leftover vegetables at the buffet.  Sometimes bok choy and garlic sauce and other times stir fry vegetables which isn't a bad option for a buffet but how about changing up the vegetables.  It was the usual suspects, carrots, zucchini and some green beans occasionally.   How about asparagus, spinach, broccoli, squash etc. ?  I'm just sayin........  They kept my room clean but I was annoyed how they would put my things away.  I'm"
485,March 2015,And again at Oakwood,NA,40,"This is now 4 or 5 times that I have visited and this time for a week. Great proximity to the Asian Development Bank if that is your business. The Goyal has most that you need- gym/fitness centre, bar, restaurant, great apartment sized rooms that are particularly good for a stay that is more than a night or two."
486,March 2015,Very good stay again!,NA,40,"This (March 2015) was my second stay at Oakwood in abt a year.  It was indeed a pleasant stay - comfortable suite; excellent amenities, well organised staff and courteous service.   This time around - my suite on the 18th floor was great (indeed much better than a smaller one I was in last time). The room was large and well laid out - and provided just the perfect space for an official trip.  The food at nostalgia was good and overall I had an excellent stay.  Just if something could be better - it would be food options - there were onyy very few vegetarian options -and some which seemed indian vegetarian options like roti bread / nan bread - even containdd eggs (so not suitable for vegetarians). I hope they could include some vegetarian options for breakfast and room service"
487,February 2015,Better than a 4-star hotel,NA,50,"Stayed here with  firstly with just me and my  wife for 4 nights on a one bedroom apartment and  then moved to a 3-bedroom on the next 4 nights with some friends on the first week of February. The apartments are  first class - spacious with graceful and pleasing to the eye furnishings.  All the bedrooms have their own private bathrooms.  There are cable  televisions everywhere -  in the lounge, in every bedroom and even in the master bathroom! We did not find faults in both the apartments that we stayed in.  The kitchens are modern and fully equipped. The service staff are courteous and very helpful. There is huge shopping mall with restaurants and supermarket that is within 5 minutes walking distance.  Public transport (jeeps, buses and metro rail) although we did not use it is"
488,March 2015,The best apartment hotel in Manila,NA,50,"This was my first stay and I had a comparison against a similar hotel (their competitor) in Manila so I could do a direct comparison.  I am a world traveller so even little things annoy me, but I couldn't fault this place from check-in to check-out.  The facilities are first class from the swimming pool to the restaurant, from the gym to the business centre.  The service is exemplary and within a day the staff were addressing me by name.  Hoe they could remember so many guests I do not know, but it adds a little extra to one's stay.  The breakfast and dinner are excellent and the bar is small, but comfortable with a three hour happy hour in the evening.  I had a one bedroom suite which was enormous and came with a dishwasher, washing machine, microwave, oven, hob and the"
489,February 2015,Great apartment hotel in Manila,NA,50,"This is a great apartment hotel in Manila. From the minute we arrived until the end of out stay we felt very welcome.  We stayed in a large two bedroom apartment with two nice bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen.  The internet connection is fast and the pool is a nice place to go for a swim.  10 minutes walk from the hotel there is a huge shopping center.  There is actually nothing you can point out is wrong. A good example of that everything is taken care of is that one day it knocked at the door. And a man asked if it was okay to change the bulb in one of the rooms.  We haven't asked for it. And this is unusual that the house keeping report such problem. Normally you have to tell them yourself if something is not working.  So all in all Oakwood is a great place to stay in"
490,March 2015,I love to stay here,NA,40,"It is the amazing experience to stay in this hotel while I attending conference in Manila. The room was clean regularly, very comfortable and facilitated by smiling personal I also enjoy the breakfast experience in Nostalgic Restaurant. I love the smoked salmon"
491,January 2015,Perfect for family who loves to cook,NA,50,"One bedroom suites is amazing! Bathroom with steam, bathtubwithTV, nice furniture and fixtures, huge space, kitchen very complete, indoor pool not warm not cold, walking distance to 4 major malls in manila, MEGAMALL,PODIUM,GALLERIA-robinsons, SHANGRILA MALL. Perfect to those who wants to save budget and variety of options to choose from. I bet you!"
492,February 2015,Awsome,NA,50,"Very impressed with the rooms we stayed in an executive suit, The room was massive, 3 toilets, 3 bedrooms, with a tv in every bathroom and a decent sized kitchen. The hotel staff were very polite and friendly. Always ensuring your safety both inside and outside the hotel. Checking cabs to see if your not being ripped off and searching to see if you left anything behind. Great advise on where to shop and eat. I would recommend this place to anyone, its worth every dollar."
493,March 2015,Really good place ,NA,50,"Been staying at Oakwood for several weeks during my first visit to the Philippines. I'm a hard judge of hotels bit I'm really enjoying the stay here. Great room, equipped with an excellent kitchenette Inc a proper oven so I can cook when I want. Supermarkets close by at Megamall and Robinsons. No bath/tub in room but the stand up shower is very very nice.   Fast Internet included in my taste. Housekeeping are excellent and the local area, despite what a previous reviewer says is perfectly safe feeling. Free car parking too if you rent  a car.   Large TV, I bought a long HDMI lead, plug in my laptop and watch UK TV using a vpn connection which the hotel wifi is fast enough to support.   Highly recommended of your are doing business nearby. "
494,December 2014,"Lack of management, disorganized staff, irregular housekeeping=roaches",NA,20,"I stayed here while traveling on business on 2 separate occasions. I was moved here from the Crowne Plaza due to my trip being extended stay. Our company had a large group of employees staying in the Philippines. Prior to our move, my company arranged for us to tour several nearby ""extended stay"" hotels, this property was chosen due to each room having in-room laundry, in-room kitchens, fitness facilities, and onsite Avis car/driver service.   I was sorely disappointed in this hotel!!   First problem we had was that Avis seemed unable to book reservations correctly for our cars/drivers to take us to/from work M-F. We had numerous occasions where there were not enough cars/drivers available or they would send a small car to pick up 6 people. These problems persisted even after"
495,March 2014,Home away from home,NA,50,"This is one of the best service apartment I have stayed so far. Every thing has been engineered by keeping customer need in mind. Staff is really cooperative, helpful and now what exact is the need of hour. Rooms are clean and equipped with all features required by a traveler. Roomsize is really big one. wish they could be associated with some miles systems."
496,January 2015,great for family stay,NA,50,"stayed here for a night with my family. Booked the 1 bedroom the suite, it was quite spacious. My 1 and a half yr old daughter had lots of room to play around. the toilet is particularly nice and big.   Check-in was okay. The only problem is it has 2 entrance which was a bit confusing at first.   The best part about the hotel is the indoor heated swimming pool with a small jacuzzi pool beside it. My daughter enjoyed it so much. It also has a playroom although, not much toys to play with inside but its enough i think for kids.    Location wise, it is very near the podium mall. Overall, its a nice hotel."
497,August 2014,Elegant luxury hotel in busy location,NA,50,This hotel is lovely and elegant. The room is spacious and furniture is in high quality. The only problem is busy lobby and not enough service attendance in the front desk. This hotel shares building with condo residents thus entry is quite crowded most of time. If there are traffic then it will take long time to get to hotel from centural business strict. There are plenty of restaurants in walking distance and also fancy mall. Nice hotel for value.
498,January 2015,Top Notch Hotel,NA,50,"I stayed only 1 night but it was memorable.  I called them 1 day before to make a reservation for a studio and I had a very pleasant experience dealing w/ their reservation dept.  Check in and check out were a breeze and the front desk was very accomodating and professional. My reservation included a breakfast buffet which offered a diverse variety of goodies and dishes.   The room and facilities were excellent (nice lap pool, well maintained gym and decent WIFI).  Overall, this hotel has everything going for them.  Proper training and maintenance is evident with staff.  I would love to stay here again for a longer duration."
499,January 2015,A standout hotel,NA,50,"Every once in a while you come across a venue where the staff go that extra mile to make themselves that much more available, that little bit more helpful and this is one such venue.  My checkin process took a little longer than expected due to my late arrival. Before too long though I was into a beautiful, large room. See photos.  The room had everything that I needed plus more. I wasn't intending to do any washing but the washing machine was so convenient. The clothes rack meant that my clothes were dry within a few hours.    During my stay here I used the room for some business meetings. This was possible by closing off the bedroom and using the dining table. A very suitable solution for me.  The included breakfast was excellent. As at Jan 15 the level 6 restaurant is being"
500,December 2014,Perfect for Family,NA,50,"My family loves hotel so much that we always try different hotels, and Oakwood became our favorite because of Location wise, walking distance to three Malls, with complete kitchen utensils so big savings when we can cook,bake,etc.."
501,January 2015,"Impeccable room, service and facilities",NA,50,"Oakwood is known hereabouts not so much as a hotel but more as serviced apartments.  There's no such thing as 'standard' rooms here as all units are suites complete with kitchen, living and dining areas with appliances like stove, full-size ref, dishwasher, microwave oven and washing machine.  The bed is just right as to firmness, the pillows are bigger than usual and can be formed to your desired height and shape.  The bath has both tub and shower, double basins with complimentary toiletries, slippers, coffee and bottled water.    Breakfast buffet was nothing fancy but tasty.  The gym is well-equipped, even the treadmill machines had individual cable TV sets!  The pool was a good 25-meter size, and has underwater music for good measure. Unlike the hotel nearby where my"
502,December 2014,Best Staycation with Family or Friends,NA,50,"We celebrated my brother's birthday here last December. The whole experience is unforgettable. Every detail of the room was good. The room we stayed is very spacious enough to accommodate large group and it has complete amenities. It has a well equipped kitchen with matching automatic dishwasher and even an automatic washing machine. The furniture and the electronics are well organized even the bathroom has its own television well positioned near the bath tub =).  The beds are clean and the hotel staff were very kind and accommodating. All smiles whenever we ask for a service.  The pool was good as well since it's an indoor pool.  All in all, we had a great stay with my family and will definitely will book here next time =)."
503,July 2014,Puts the Premier in Hotel Service,NA,40,"Big hotels seldom get reviews, especially good ones, since they are expected to deliver nothing but quality service. Much more a big hotel part of an international brand such as Oakwood. But this hotel definitely proved why they have been chosen as the 'Travelers' Choice' in 2014 by Trip Advisor and awarded the 2014 Trip Advisor Certificate of Excellence, as well as the other 9 hotel chains across Asia.  My partner and I's experience was a splendid one. The staycation was because of my partner's birthday. I had planned and went to the hotel to cook up a surprise. Needless to say, the staff were more excited than I was. Everyone was very supportive of my plans including the kitchen people who also gave us a complementary birthday cake made with a huge block of chocolate topped"
504,December 2014,The best christmas staycation,NA,40,"I always wanted to stay at oakwood but the rates are so high that we couldn't afford. Thanks a lot for their premiere holiday stay promo for 6000nett without breakfast, we availed it for 2 nights and we celebrated our family holiday. My kids loved the tub with tv. Tv's are everyehere. And i love the kitchen so much. I cook our meals and we had a great savings rather than eating out. We almost missed our early flight on our last day because we woke up late but thanks to Ms. Lozano, the frontdesk who handled our check-in and check out efficiently. I just hope they offer low rates and promos so that people can afford to stay. Hoping to be back soon"
505,December 2014,We found a Home =),NA,50,"I remember when we first checked in at Oakwood and literally I am amazed from rooms to service.  So last Dec 17, my Aunt came home from US as a balikbayan and we recommended this hotel to her in order to experience the homey like place. She stayed there from Dec 17 to January 1 and we accompanied her during that period.  We had an amazing experience and we really felt that it is our 2nd home. The staffs are very accommodating specially the guy at the reception named Jake. He made us feel that Oakwoof is our Home.   We will definitely go back here!  Thank you Oakwood for the awesome stay! Keep it up!"
506,December 2014,Perfect!,NA,50,"This is by far the best hotel we have ever experienced. We booked this hotel thru RatesToGo for an overnight stay for New year's eve. We got a 1BR suite and the room was HUGE, It's almost a full-sized apartment with complete kitchen top-brand appliances: 10cu ft ref, washing machine, cooktop stove, oven, dishwashing machine, microwave oven, coffee maker and tea pot. It also has three LED TVs; one in the living room, in the bedroom and inside the toilet beside the huge bath tub. The toilet has a separate enclosed shower where you can also do sauna and also a separate huge bath tub. The only thing missing is a bidet for the toilet seat. The bed was king-sized and was super comfortable. The windows are from floor to ceiling which made watching fireworks really enjoyable. The"
507,December 2014,"Great place, great staff, great stay....with a caveat...",NA,40,"My niece recommended Oakwood after a not so great stay at a nearby hotel. The place is great, its near everything and within walking distance of two big malls. I booked a one bedroom suite for 16 days. I love how big the hotel room is overall.   The bedroom has a king size bed and the bathroom is nice. The hotel reception staff is very helpful, courteous and professional. Jake at the front desk went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. Maggie from housekeeping is also the best, she gave me 2 shoe racks and a dish rack for my use for the duration of my stay. Give these two a good salary raise, they deserve all the accolades.  What I like is the free breakfast on the 6th floor which is very convenient. They have a good selection of food choices. And there is a gym not to"
508,December 2014,Didn't want to go home.,NA,50,This was the best hotel that I ever stayed in my life. They made blue collar worker like me feel like I was ruch and powerful. Our stay here was they perfect end to our vacation and the breakfast buffet was a great send off to the long lines at the airport. If you stay here save yourself the hassle with taxes and arrange for there car service. It is less expensive. The malls are just blocks away and inside of them you will find supermarkets incase you wish to cook your own meals.
509,December 2014,Excellent accomodations & location,NA,50,"Our son booked us rooms for his wedding.  The entourage would stay overnight because of the 9am wedding.  My husband & I had a huge one-bedroom room all to ourselves. It had a kitchenette complete with stove, oven, ref & washing machine. The living/dining area was also spacious & could sleep two people.  Our king-sized bed could easily sleep 3 adults comfortably.  The bathroom had a bathtub & a separate shower with glass enclosure.  With the floor to ceiling glass walls, we had an excellent view of the Podium & St. Francis Square.  Walking distance would be SM Megamall & Robinsons Galleria.    Security is very tight.  They'll give you access cards to your room.  I had to go to my daughter-in-law's room for make-up at the 12th floor which my son wrote in his note.  Our room was"
510,July 2014,Our new favorite hotel!,NA,50,"The aftermath of Typhoon Glenda in July 2014 left us without electricity for 3 days. On the second night without electricity, we decided to check in at the last minute at Oakwood because our ""polar bear"" toddler had trouble sleeping in the heat (We checked in past 10:00 PM already). Oakwood Premier Joy-Nostalg was such a welcome place for us -- filled with surprises! Even if we got the cheapest room that we could find (studio), the room filled us with so much delight, from the fully-furnished kitchen, to the sauna & TV in the shower, to the washing machine and even office table, which was just perfect for me as I had work deadlines to finish the next day! Even our toddler had lots of fun playing in their play room on the 5th floor.  Their breakfast selection was not as big as"
511,December 2013,Amazing Stay,NA,50," We arrived late in the night and the hotel staff were more than happy to welcome us, we took the 1 BR suite for an initial stay of 3D2N but we enjoyed our stay so much that we ended up extending up to 6 days, the rooms are spacious with a fully equipped kitchen and laundry area, and the bathroom has a nice bathtub with flatscreen tv! Some of the furnitures in the living area were a bit old fashioned but very comfy. One thing though, the cleaning staff were a bit too eager to finish cleaning up that they have opened the room when we were not able to answer immediately, we were sleeping and we were a little surprised to see them inside. The next days we just asked them to clean when we are out which they happily obliged to. All in all it was a really good stay! Would definitely"
512,November 2014,Very nice hotel,NA,50,"We got a 1 bedroom suite and it did not disappoint. The place was spacious and cozy. The kitchen was complete with cooking and eating stuff. It even has a laundry/drying machine. There was TV at the living room, bedroom and even the bathroom! The bath tub was quite big also and we enjoyed the sauna at the shower area. Our favorite part of the hotel is the heated indoor pool, both the big one and the kiddie pool. Though they are strict with the use of pool area, maximum of 4 people only per room, otherwise they charge 1k for extra adult and Php 500 for extra kids. The staff were also accommodating. We will definitely come back to this hotelü"
513,November 2014,Just Near ADB,NA,40,This was a very comfortable stay - the room was extremely generous both in size and amenities. I have stayed here before when visiting ADB and would highly recommend it for its convenience. The gym is also very generous and well equipped. Breakfast was good as were the other meals that is had whilst participating in a workshop.
514,November 2014,great staycation,NA,40,"We loved our stay at the Oakwood. We got the 2 bedroom executive suite and it was huge, clean, comfortable and fully equipped. It had all that we needed. The professional pictures of the hotel did not disappoint. It was real. My kids had the best weekend ever. They kept on saying this for the entire weekend we were there. The heated pool and jacuzzi was splendid. Just what we needed to relax and bond with the family. A special shoutout to the hotel staff at the Oakroom, the swimming pool and the frontdesk. Very professional indeed. Will definitely come back to this hotel."
515,November 2014,Great choice for the Ortigas Area,NA,40,"Stayed here over the weekend; we were billed in a very well-appointed two bed room suite. We found the rooms very spacious and tastefully decorated. The hotel provided all the basic amenities (toiletries, slippers, robes, wifi) and the suite had everything you'd expect from a  5* hotel. For the hotel's recreational facilities, the hotel had 20 m indoor lap pool and a well-equipped fitness center.  Overall, I thought the hotel very much met our expectations-  the hotel gave other more established and full-serviced hotels a run for their money. A two bedroom suite for the price of a regular double room in neighboring hotels is an absolute steal. A word of caution though, the hotel is really a serviced apartment (and has many long-staying guests), so one has to correctly set their"
516,September 2014,A Suite Escape,NA,40,"I won't play coy and just get straight to the point. I loved our stay at Oakwood!   We've been to a couple of serviced suites around the metro (and at one time even became members of some) and it is by far the best we've been to. It's strategic location in the Ortigas Centeral Business District is an added bonus.   We stayed overnight in a one-bedroom suite. The room was huge, no, ginormous is probably more fitting.  Essentially, the room speaks of old english luxury with a modern twist through, not only its design, but also through the thoughtful choice of expensive furniture and appliances.   The kitchen area has a state-of-the-art washer and dryer, induction stove and oven,  a two door heavy-duty refrigerator, a dishwasher and a microwave oven. Kitchen utensils and pots and"
517,November 2014,Excellent property for urban staycation,NA,40,"I just recently stayed here for 3 nights.  One bedroom suite was quite spacious, nearly double the space of a comparable 5 star hotel with full living room and working kitchen. The bedroom was big and so was the bathroom with tub.  The property is quite well maintained.  Breakfast options at Oakroom are decent. Friendly and accommodating staff for the most part.    Point for improvement is that the amenities are not refreshed per day(coffee, tea, toiletries)."
518,August 2014,My favorite place.,NA,50,"I've stayed for quite a number of times here, maybe 6 to 8 times, and they never disappoint (except for my late check-out requests which was granted just once. Haha).   1. Check-in and out are always done fast that even if i see long queues at times, it does not discourage me.  2. The rooms i've stayed in are always fresh though maybe once or twice the cupboards were dusty.  3. Service was quick whenever we needed assistance (i.e., washing machine help, kitchen mopping, make-up and turndown of rooms, extra utensils request, etc.). 4. Staff was friendly and courteous in the Oakroom and pool. 5. Security was great.  6. Best thing, the rooms are spacious. We were able to do a small baby shower and a simple send-off party for our friends.  Surely you wont be disappointed. And i'm"
519,May 2014,The Best Serviced Apartments in Manila,NA,50,"If you are looking for a serviced apartment that offers the lot, this is the place for you. It is close to all the shops and transport, the staff are the most friendliest and most helpful you can find, it is just like they were hand picked. The rooms are spacious and very clean, very fast internet access and a 5 star restaurant with 5 star service. Oakwood is a very safe place for your family, it offers security access in the lifts and security as you enter the hotel. This is honestly the best place and an affordable place for short or long term. I stayed for 6 months and it was a home away from home."
520,October 2014,Best value for your money!,NA,50,"Everything was perfect, from our smooth check-in to the fully-equipped amenities in our spacious rooms. The breakfast buffet had a somewhat limited choice of food, but they were all delicious. Its location is also accessible to nearby malls. One comment though, our stay could have been better if there were bidets installed in the bathroom, for convenience.   Our overall experience in Oakwood was great and unparalleled; we would love to come back again."
521,June 2014,Home away from home,NA,40,"I have stayed here frequently since 2010, and the hotel continues to maintain its excellent standards.  I stayed in a spacious one-bedroom suite.  The breakfast is sumptuous, but not too many healthy and vegetarian options!"
522,October 2014,Modern and clean high end serviced apartments ,NA,40,"Nice and large space both for the room and the living area.   Nice finishing, giving a luxury feel to it.   Bathroom fitting is great with large and stylish bath tube.   Very nice high end feel at the reception too.   One minus point is that it's a bit dead at night. It is located a short walk away from the shangri-la plaza though so it mitigates this a bit.  "
523,October 2014,Excellent Accommodations,NA,50,"My wife and I stayed in a Executive Studio on the 16th Floor.  The check in was smooth and the agent was very helpful. The room was great with many amenities.  The room comes with a fully equipped kitchen with stove, oven, microwave, sink, and full size refrigerator. There is an in room washer dryer unit, led tv/multimedia unit, iron, safe, robes and plenty of storage.  The bathroom is modern and comfortable also with its own TV.  The breakfast buffet was well stocked and the dining room is comfortable.  Service is very attentive and friendly.  There is a business center that has a library of books and dvd movies for loan. Although we didn't use the gym or pool facilities,  they are available.   I highly recommend this hotel for stays in this area. The convenience of SM Megamall"
524,October 2014,Perfect for business and pleasure!,NA,50,"Stayed at their 1-bedroom suite and it's huge enough for 4. Kitchen, dining and living are spacious enough for one to do both work and personal errands. Room is actually too huge in relation to the bed size though...bathroom is perfectly done with a bath tub and built in steam room (convertible to shower area). Room is fully furnished from  oven, dishwasher, washing machine/dryer to kitchen utensils. Amenities include a lapping pool, gym and a business center.   This place is actually a home away from home especially if you are an expat assigned to Manila or from some out of town. All you need is already inside the suite.  Building is safe and you need a card to access the elevator so it comes with some privacy and added security as well.  Location is within Ortigas CBD and"
525,August 2014,Like home. ,NA,40,"I enjoyed my stay (twice) at Oakwood. Location is not great - a 10 min walk to the malls along some dingy shops, but if you only want a high class apartment and order room  service in, this is the place to be.   Getting a taxi is easy, and they have enough staff to answer any questions you may have and also open the doors whenever you walk towards one.   This place has the most comfortable bed and pillows ever and for a week, I woke up thinking I was home. "
526,October 2014,Review of Oakwood Premier Joy-Nistalg Center Manika,NA,50,"We stayed at Oakwood for 5 nights. As we landed into Manila quite late we had pre-arranged transfers to the hotel, however there are numerous taxis waiting outside arrivals (I didn't see any buses) but I know there's no Metro / Train. The journey by car took exactly an hour to the hotel, traffic was very very bad, even at midnight! (Mainly due to road works close to the airport) Check-in was very quick and the lady in reception was very pleasant and welcoming and informed us where areas were in the hotel (pool, spa, gym, breakfast etc...), the lady also gave us our wifi login & password which could be used on x4 devices (which was good as we actually had 4) Our room was located on the 11th floor (room 1113), upon entering we were more than delighted!  To the left, as we entered"
527,September 2014,"Good hotel, a bit lacking in the customer service skills",NA,40,"Our stay here was good since the room and pool facilities were great.  As the title says, a bit lacking though in the customer skills department:  A.  Your certain female guest services officer's attitude is appalling.  We had a misunderstanding about the room, and she was continuously blaming me on the phone to the point of even hanging up on me!  When I called back for the Nth time, I got a male gso, and luckily he was very polite and accommodating, and actually understood and resolved my dilemma.  Kudos to him, and also to the female supervisor who did apologize to us when we finally checked in.  B.  We found the kitchen utensils/dinnerware/silverware lacking, so I must admit I was requesting a lot of extras from housekeeping.  The housekeeping guy on our first night was"
528,September 2014,Great value for family style condo/hotel,NA,40,"In a business district, easy access. Tremendous value for price vs. what you get. A 2 bedroom suite for $140? yes please.   Pro: Lots of room. Full kitchen with washer/dryer. Clean spacious well designed bathroom. Multi zone AC central air.  Cons: Staff has no idea how to use appliances. And the washer had no instructions and the design from hell. Public areas of the hotel kinda blah. Definitely geared towards business needs."
529,September 2014,Great location for business and restaurants,NA,40,The hotel is located perfectly for local businesses. The overall impression was of the tremendous space provided in the rooms. I was on the 24th floor and had a great vista over the city. Breakfast was plentiful and service was great.I would recommend this hotel to anyone doing business in the Pasig City area.
530,September 2014,In the top 5 I have ever stayed in,NA,50,"This is a wonderful hotel. The suites are huge and very well equipped, comfortable and spotlessly clean. The breakfast is excellent with a good variety and enough staff serving to ensure all is fine. Reception could not be more helpful and the porterage and all services were excellent. My only quibble would be the bar. Not the staff, who were most attentive, but the general design was not consistent with the rest of the hotel. It looked like an after thought. I would add the kitchen had everything except a corkscrew, but maybe the previous guest took a liking to it? But do not let that influence you against this hotel. It is outstanding and well worth 5 stars."
531,September 2014,An Apartment and Hotel in One,NA,50,"After being away from home for so long it has been delightful staying here at Oakwood Premier. The apartment has cooking facilities, which has made the last month of my trip much more pleasurable. The apartment is well fitted out with an excellent modern kitchen and all the appliances. The shower is also a steam room. The staff are amazing. It is centrally located for Ortigas, Eastwood and Makati. So much to do in the area. Special thanks to Jake, Carlo, Kelvin, Adrian, Clarissa, Patrick, Bal and most of all Matt from House Keeping. Will definitely return."
532,October 2013,Convenient,NA,50,"We stayed at Oakwood Premier Nostalg for 1 month, my husband stayed for 4 months  during our transition from Jakarta. It's walking distance from his office and has many shops, mall and restaurant around. The place itself is homey. We got a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom service aprtment. It has kitchen that includes  pot, pan, plates and other kitchen utensil. I forgot which floor but they have a playroom for children. We only visited  twice during our stay since my girls feels its babyish. They prefer to swim. You can see the swimming pool from the gym. I usually exercise while they swim. I feel its safe since I can check them time to time. After swimming and exercising we all shower at the changing room and go back and relax at our apartment. Since we have our own kitchen in the room we"
533,September 2014,Hard to Fault,NA,40,"I had a one bedroom suite and can't think of much they could have added. Bed bathroom and living room / kitchen all great. 96 channels of TV .. and I could understand about 20. Bid bedroom with vanity. bathroom for a crowd and I don't know enough people in Manila to fill the living room .   What can I fault.... location maybe. Unless you are visiting Asia  Development Bank ( opposite), San Miguel or another major corporate , this is not the place to be. It is the business district. Yes there are 3 big malls within walking distance, but pubs an restaurants are few unless you want TGIs or down market chains. At least 20 coffee chains within 200 metres.   Breakfast.. average. But nothing to complain about.  I could stay there  a along time,  would get bored with the surrounds but"
534,September 2014,Exceptional Service - AMAZING!,NA,50,"The amenities were all good! I love the ambiance of the hotel, all the staffs were hospitable especially the housekeeping. they're all willing help us and assist us. Many thank you to you guys! I will be visiting oakwood  soon :) thumbs up!"
535,September 2014,What happened to Oakwood?,NA,10,"When we got there, there were no more available parking so i had to avail of the valet service. But they didnt have enough parkers so we had to wait for one. Then no one was available to take our luggage/bags. They said to just leave it at the lobby. But when a bellboy tried getting luggage from another person, thinking it was ours I got scared he might lose our bags. The poor guy was so harassed as he was the only one in the lobby to take care of everyone. So my kids and I just took our bags ourselves to our room.  The room was spacious and modern. The kitchenette was old. the kitchen top had seen better days. They should have put first class granite instead of the existing granite-looking sad top that they have there. they provided 1 toothbrush only, what gives? the room has 1"
536,September 2014,The best hotel in the Urbanity,NA,50,"Stayed for only 1 day - 1 night and I regret that I didn't book for more days. Oakwood Premier gave me a luxury experience for just an affordable price.   Receptionists were really friendly. Rooms are very spacious and modern.  Though the menu were a bit expensive, the residence offers a kitchen in which you can cook your own meal. It's a plus since the hotel is accessible to various supermarket.  It's a big THUMBS UP!"
537,May 2014,They even accept dogs!,NA,50,"We have stayed 5 weeks in Oakwood while relocating to Manila, and we were arriving with my wife and my dog. They accomodate us in the best way possible, we had an excellent service and we could stay even with our dog. There is an equiped kitchen in the apartments which was very useful for us to avoid eating out every day for over one month. The staff is friendly, breakfast is very good and it is conveniently located if you need ot work in or around Ortigas. I highly recommend this hotel."
538,December 2013,For Family affairs,NA,50,"The 2 bedroom unit has complete dining facilities. The furniture is perfect including the televisions on each toilet, laundry and cooking range. The room is huge for a 2 bedroom suite. The pool is also well maintained. The parking is very convenient. Podium Mall is just across. 24/7 marts are just around the corner. Overall, I give 5 stars."
539,July 2014,Best decision I ever made!,NA,50,"Stayed for a week. Got the one-bedroom suite. Everything you need is there, where you need them. There's a full kitchen but I never used it. Bed and beddings are top class. I also tried the pool and jacuzzi which made my stay more memorable. Location is convenient because of its proximity to shopping malls. I also need to mention how the staff made me feel at home. All my requests have been attended to with care. Special thanks to the duty officer, Mae Goyeneche and the very professional receptionists and bellboys. I would definitely recommend this to my colleagues and friends."
540,August 2014,"The ""Queen"" this side of town",NA,40,"With the intent of taking a breather from the stress I was feeling from work in the past few weeks, me and my husband booked an Executive Studio at Oakwood Premier via Agoda. At 30% off, we only paid Php 6.4K (inclusive of Agoda's booking fees) for a one night getaway.  We arrived at 3PM. Parking was a bit tight but not extremely space-challenged as other hotels I have stayed in (if you compare it to the parking area of Discovery Suites located a block away).   The front desk upgraded us to a 1 BR Suite at no extra cost. The cheery front desk person asked us if this was our first time in the hotel because if yes, the upgrade would be a welcome surprise.  She was definitely correct! We stayed at a corner room (2604) and to our delight, the moment we opened the door, both my"

Excellent wifi connection."
542,August 2014,Deserves to be #1,NA,50,"This hotel deserves to be # 1 not only in Pasig area but the whole Metro Manila. The rooms are excellent! Its rates are more than reasonable. Every furniture or amenity is at its best. The kitchen, bathroom, bed and living room are comfortable to stay/work in.   This is my friends favorite hotel. You'll never go wrong. It has been 4th time here and we still haven't experience any discomfort or inconvenience."
543,July 2014,Spacious and Luxurious,NA,40,We stayed here from July 23 to July 30 on a two bedroom residence. I booked with two breakfast buffet thorugh a combiantion of internet and actual direct contact with the booking personnel.  We emjoyed the breakfast buffet as the personnel even greets me every morning by my name. It made the stay very personal. I liked the residence itself. It is spacious and very clean. They did clean the unit everyday and the toiltries were replenished everyday. The SM megamall and robinson's galleria were all walking distance. I Liked the idea that I can acces entry on the ADB side and the Topaz Rd.  The gym and the swimming were awesome. We also used the spa for mani - pedi. This is also good.  Personnel were all very friendly. Definitley will stay here again.
544,July 2014,My Second Home in Manila :),NA,50,"This is by far the best hotel in Ortigas. It is great for families with young kids. It is modern & luxurious with all the comforts of a home. We always stay in a 1 bedroom suite & its really worth every penny. Spacious rooms with bathtub and full kitchen amenities. There are 3 TV sets with 1 in the bathroom (perfect while soaking in the bathtub!). We also love the heated swimming pool. Service is excellent and staff are very friendly. The location is great as well. It is in the heart of Ortigas - near SM Megamall, Robinsons, Podium & St Francis Square (all within walking distance). Will keep coming back here for sure!."
545,July 2014,"Luxurious rooms, great value for money",NA,50,"I stayed one night over the weekend with my wife and we booked a one bedroom deluxe room. We booked the room online as the prices for booking in advance were cheaper on the internet than when you tried to book over the phone directly. (Not really sure why this is an online only promo thing. This fact, as well as having multiple websites for the hotel on the internet, made for some pre-booking confusion).  The hotel is located in a very good location. It is inside one of the central business districts in Metro Manila and there are a lot of malls all around it as well as convenience stores and restaurants. There are at least two malls that are in walking distance so you could just eat there instead of availing of the hotel's expensive private dining options.  Finding a parking"
546,July 2014,Superb Staff,NA,50,"We stayed in the hotel overnight with my kids. Staffs are all accommodating, polite and smiling. We had a huge space, fully equipped kitchen area, however, there's no bidet and exhaust in the bathroom is not working (rm2801).  It was almost a great stay except when my kid got his ring finger pinched accidentally in the door, near the pool. The staff was quick and informed the Nurse on duty immediately for first aid. My son was brought to the nearest hospital for surgery. Kudos to Ms. Jen, who was the Nurse of duty and accompanied us to the hospital, also to Ms.Lala of the front desk for extending our stay for few hours with no charge. Highly recommended hotel, we'll be back for sure."
547,July 2014,Your home away from home......,NA,50,"We had a one hour delay arriving , so our family were already waiting for us at the lobby. So i was already stressed when i arrived. But the check-in was efficient and swift, that i felt at ease immediately. We stayed on the 26th floor, and had a fantastic view. I enjoyed the classic furnishings paired with the modern appliances. Ten minutes upon arrival, i was using the digitlal oven, and glass stove, and was setting up for dinner. We were too stressed to go out due to the delay, so we opted to dine in. After dinner, the automatic dishwasher was great to have!  At the same time, started doing laundry with the combo washer-dryer, and in 2 hours, the full load of laundry was done! There is STEAM iron(yes, not one of those cheap ones which doesnt remove one crease) so i was able"
548,July 2014,perfect for stay-cation. stayed with 2 toddlers.,NA,50,"i got a membership in oakwood. and used a voucher for this 1-br unit (i only paid 4k for an overnight stay in this spacious fully equipped room).  this third stay was the best. their service improved. or at least i didnt encounter the staff who didnt do well during my first stay. the frontliner (in my 3rd stay) gave me an excellent service from check in to small requests to check out. it was a breeze. during my first stay, the frontliner (guy) ruined the start of my stay. but this time, everything went well.  perfect for ""stay-cation"". fully equipped with dishwasher, microwave, ref with big freezer, oven, stove, pots and pans, coffee maker, electric kettle, pots and pans, dishes, knife and chopping board, can opener. while in the bathroom, there's a tv, wet sauna inside the"
549,June 2014,All good except for the water heater,NA,40,"I stayed 2 nights in Oakwood from 25-27 June 2014. I have no complaints with regards to the location, rooms, cleanliness & service - they were good! However, the management may like to look into improving the water heater system as the heater is not even warm at all."
550,June 2014,Good location for business.,NA,40,The location of this hotel is best. Especially for businessman who has meeting in ortigas or pasig. Room facilities are excellent. There are a laundry machine in each room. 3 TV in a room. And the quality of breakfast buffet is pretty good. There are various fruits. 
551,June 2014,Excellent (for business),NA,40,"The hotel is excellent. Staff is friendly and receptive. Very attentive. Room was clean and the configuration was very nice. Wi-fi it's very good. Two items for consideration:  #1. TV was too close to the bed and your eyes get tired after watching a single movie. #2. The room I stayed in (#2108) didn't have a working exhaust system in the toilet. I had a foul odor on nights one and three. For the second night housekeeping went in and fixed it.  Restaurant and bar are excellent. Very nice prices, presentation and food.  Swimming pool and gym....not good. Mosquitoes everywhere around the swimming pool makes it unpleasant. And the limitation on having a drink or a snack also doesn't help. According to the staff : ""it's forbidden"". That's a word not used very often in high quality"
552,June 2014,Classy Hotel,NA,50,"Oakwood Premier is the newest hotel we have stayed at in Manila area. The two bedroom serviced apartment we stayed in had everything we needed; a fully equipped kitchen (including a dish washer), big dining table, 4 TVs (1 in the bathroom), 2 en-suites and even a washing machine and dryer. The entire hotel including the lobby, restaurant, gym and pool were modern and well furnished. The staff always had smiles on their faces and were extremely helpful and accommodating. The breakfast was amazing, a good variety of food from different cultures. The location was very central, located in between 2 major shopping centers (Megamall and Robinsons) which were only a short 10 minute walk away. We had such a good experience that we decided to re-book at Oakwood Premier after returning"
553,May 2014,One of the best in Manila area,NA,50,"It is hard to find a modern and new hotel in Manila generally. Oakwood is modern, well-furnished, and there's a washing machine in every room as well, which is great for long stays.  Stayed here for 10 nights, and it was cozy. The breakfast was good too, and staff are generally quite friendly.   The swimming pool is long and indoors, making it possible to swim in any weather! It is also very clean and does not contain too much chlorine. The gym is well-equipped and modern.   The hotel is within walking distance to nearby malls and Podium, easy to get anything you need, and food as well.   There was only one disturbance at 12 midnight one night when someone played very loud music, and I had to call up reception to complain. It was promptly attended to, and settled. I do wonder if"
554,June 2014,Deserving to be number one!,NA,50,Oakwood Premier is a very good hotel. It has great rooms. They are well- furnished and everything looks luxurious. We have been regularly staying here for the past 5 years. The staff are very friendly especially Ms. Era from Front Desk who has been attending to us since our first stay. She is very nice and accommodating and really cares about us. She makes us feel very welcome and goes out of her way to make sure all of us are well taken care of. It's always a wonderful experience for us staying in this hotel. Keep up the good work! I hope you have more staff like Ms. Era because we will certainly keep on coming back!!!
555,December 2013,Amazing Place for a Great Value,NA,50,My sister and I stayed here for a couple days when we first arrived in Manila in December.  We first were situated in an executive studio which we thought was amazing.  We were then moved to a deluxe 1 bedroom which was fantastic.  It's spacious and very clean.  Room service was very prompt and very courteous and kind.  Housekeeping was good too.  The staff was kind and very helpful.  In room kitchen for those who want to cook.  I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to friends as well as me coming back to stay.
556,May 2014,Secured and walking distance to malls,NA,40,"We stayed in a one bedroom Suite, room is very clean and very cozy, we got 3 flatscreen tv's, that they put one at the comfort room infront of a bath tub..whew, so relaxing... the breakfast is superb, wherein they specify for some halal food... the pool is nice, and i loved the jacuzzi.."
557,May 2014,All about the staff,NA,50,"This is my 2nd time to stay in Oakwood and again the have exceeded my expectations. From Lala or reservations I guess or Front desk, she is very accomodating and answered all my questions regarding my reservation. She was very helpful and showed patience in handling customers like me. Good job! Then next is my experience with one of the airport reps who is Dion, very helpful when it comes to assisting us with our luggages and Blu i guess thag is his name for being polite while waiting for our payment for our delivered food. I was also impress that every single time that i will ride the elevator and a hotel staff would enter, they would acknowledge us and greet and upon leaving the elevator, they always say excuse me before stepping out the lift. Good customer service training."
558,May 2014,"Great location, clean and spacious room",NA,50,"For six days this was my and baby's home while I was on a business trip. The studio room was spacious for 2 adults, and was clean and comfortable. The equipment worked well, from the kitchen to the washing machine to the Internet speed. There's even a sauna in the bathroom. The people are helpful and smiling. Food at restaurant is delicious and fresh.   Location is great. Across the hotel is The Podium mall, where there are restaurants. For grocery, one can go to 7-11 or Watson's, or Robinson's Galleria, which are all walking distance.  Highly recommended, especially if there is a promo rate!"
559,May 2014,Highly recommended for a comfortable stay,NA,50,"The Oakwood has  been a stay option of choice for the last four years now. It is conveniently located in Ortigas and has good proximity to some of the major malls like Megamall, Podium, Robinsons, etc. Greenhills is also a few minutes drive away or a 3 km walk at most.   The USP that keeps bringing me back to this hotel is the warmth and friendliness of the staff coupled with the quality of the hotel itself and their services. The rooms are well appointed with all the amenities that a business traveler or a vacationing family would need including home appliances like a washing machine, iron, TV, boombox, etc. They also have a well equipped kitchen with a refrigerator, cooking range, microwave, cutlery and utensils, etc. The highlight of the room was of course the Sauna built"
560,May 2014,Mother's Day Special!!,NA,50,"Check in was a breeze, staffs were so friendly with my young kids. We had a great time with our 2 bedroom suite. My kids had a lot of fun having bubble bath while watching tv in the bathroom. They have a nice small playroom with little tikes slide and some stuffed toys and balls which the kids also enjoyed. The swimming pool is an indoor pool. They have a small jacuzzi where my kids spent most of their swimming time. Parking space was spacious. Super lots of things to do in the hotel, and since we were not yet done with everything.. I asked the hotel if we could have a late check out.. and they granted it to me at no cost. What a memorable mother's day celebration!!!"
561,May 2014,Excellent Accommodations,NA,50,"Stayed at Oakwood during my business visit to Asian Development Bank located directly across the street from Oakwood.  Staff is prompt, courteous, helpful.  Accommodation excellent--good working desk, lamp, internet connection. Very comfortable bed.  Will stay here again. Sher G Singh"

We got a 1 bedroom suite, complete with living room, dining and kitchen equipped with all the necessary utensils and kitchen equipments.  We checked in on my natal day, I brought in cooked food to be Pre heated that night for our family dinner.  There's an oven where I Pre heated y lasagna and chicken relleno, the stove where I pre heated my beef stew.  We had salad and cake. My kids came with their families, it was a nice simple celebration.   I had 2 of my grand kids stayed over so they can enjoy the place and since they have a play ground, they enjoyed that too.  Included in our stay is breakfast, so the 4 of us had breakfast in their coffee shop.  We then proceeded to the pool area and"
563,April 2014,Great HOTEL!!! Highly recommended!!!,NA,50,"We came back from our Plantation Bay trip and booked  2 nights (Apr 4 & 5, 2014) on this hotel. Great customer service, good location, close to Robinson Galeria.  Staff are very friendly and courtious always greets you. When we checked out after few days we noticed we forgot out Camera charger and battery, we called the hotel and informed them about the items we left behind.They immidietly notify their security see anything leff accountted from that room. They found the items the day we checked out and stored it. We were happy about the way they value thier customers. Compared to the bad expirienced we had at Discovery Suite, my wife stuff got stolen ($150) worth and nothing happen, thief still out there working and Discovery did not compensate our lost, cheap management and"
564,April 2014,"Good Stay, bit steep on the price",NA,40,"My stay at Oakwood in April 2014 was comfortable. I liked the room (a studio apartment with small living area, kitchen and bed). The service and facilities were good. Also, the restuarant was decent.  On the good parts -I liked the rooms (albeit for the price I paid, I was expecting a bit larger rooms). The amenities and room facilities appear new and were in good working condition. Also the staff was courteous and helpful.  On things I did like to be better - size of the room, price and possibly more vegetarian choices on the menu."
565,May 2014,Suprisingly it is one of my best trip so far,NA,50,"Initially me and my girl friends stayed in two bedroom executive apartment (8th May - 10th May 2014) for a business trip. It was daunting for all of us as this is our first time visiting Manila. The Hotel location is very Strategic though, Seven Eleven and Starbucks is just 5 minutes walking from the hotel (which is awesome!). Robinson Mall where we can do our last minute shopping, only took us probably less than 10 minutes walk to get there. For me, location wise this Hotel has ticked all of my boxes. Especially for a first timer like us.  The service is excellent, The front desk officer all of them were very warm and friendly, but Marco at the front desk is exceptional I have to thank him as I really enjoyed the last day of my stay in Manila. My flight arrival and departure"
566,February 2014,Serene Stay,NA,40,"Stayed here last February 2014  Booked a one studio room for one night. Hotel is located at the heart of Ortigas CBD.   To start off, parking was a challenge. They gave us a corner slot where we needed to fit between walls. Most slots are reserved for ADB and parking tenants. Anything left would be given to hotel guests. Going up from the parking to the lobby was like a maze. We had to walked to this narrow hallway. Check in was fast and efficient though.   The studio room was spacious and well-maintained. It comes with a fully functional kitchen which we were able to utilized. The sofa was inviting and relaxing. My personal favorite is the bed and pillows. It gave me a serene & refreshing sleep. Black out curtains and sound-proof windows gave an added pleasant rest.  The"
567,April 2014,Good for Family,NA,40,"We got a two bedroom suite, it was complete with everything that you'll ever need down to the wine corkscrew. Clean and cosy. Handy. Modern interior. Buffet breakfast has a variety of choice. Although children's playroom could do with toys and rubber turf smells and is a little offensive on the nose. Overall very good. Except for the playroom."
568,April 2014,A temporary escape within the Metro!,NA,40,"Had an overnight stay in Oakwood with family just to ease the bustling and noisy life of the metro. Located at the back of SM Megamall and Ortigas offices, one can still find peace in this hotel. Not to mention how secured this hotel is. Jump in your comfy bed after a nice stroll in the district of Ortigas.   This may be your best escape within the city if you want to temporarily ease the stressful life of the Metro."
569,March 2014,Very convenient...close to major shops,NA,50,"This i think is the most strategic in terms of access to public transportation, shops and places to eat.  Less than 10 minutes walk to Robinson's Galleria.  Across the street from Podium mall, which is across the street from Mega Mall, which again is across the street from Shangri-la mall!!!!  I stayed in a studio with a king size bed on the 11th floor.  I had a full kitchen, tons of closet space, bathroom has no bath tub, but its ok.  Plus it has a washer (i never get to use it since it does not completely dry clothes, which means, I still need to hang it to dry).  Attentive staff.  Gym was more than sufficient, and the indoor pool.  Nice.  Did not take the breakfast, since there's a lot of places to go to anyway."
570,March 2014,Comfortable and accommodating,NA,50,"I stayed in one of the Excecutive studios and was impressed to see how efficient the layout was. The kitchen (I didn't use) had places, cookware, and storage- the only thing missing was a dishwasher! The bathroom was spacious and the closet area had lots of room to store bags and hang clothes. The was a niche with a desk, and a small closet that hid the washer/dryer. I did try to use the dryer, but it didn't quite seem to do the job. Letting the clothes hang for a little while afterwards made everything OK. This was my first time in Manila and the staff was extremely helpful in recommending shops and nightlife areas and arranging for a day taxi and figuring out what museums to visit each day based on their proximity to one another (thank you, Marco!). I had hoped to use the"
571,July 2013,Must Stay,NA,50,"The best place when planning to stay in the Ortigas Area. Malls are just walking distance from the hotel. Stayed here several times and i totally appreciate the big rooms and the luxurious bathrooms with bathtub, sauna, tons of room amenities, tv and his and hers sink. Only drawback is the very limited breakfast buffet selection and wait staff must be more sensitive to guest needs.Overall, this is my must stay place in Ortigas."
572,February 2014,"Great Rooms, awful experience at the pool area",NA,40,"Overnight stay cation with family at a 2-bedroom suite. Room was really nice! Rooms pros and cons:   Pros:  - Generous-sized living, dining and kitchen area  - Kitchen complete with all the basic (and not so basic) utensils and equipment  - Rooms were clean and large  - Bathroom were clean and well-maintained   Cons:  - steam shower wasn't working well. It wouldn't go past a certain temperature (30 degrees), thus we weren't really able to enjoy this amenity  - bathtub fixture were not ""designed well"". When you try to draw a bath, there will be inevitable spills from the faucet no matter how careful you are  - The time we stayed, I tried requesting for an extra blanket and I was told they ran out and I was offered a flat sheet instead   I also brought my son to the Kids play area"
573,March 2014,Excellent option in Ortigas,NA,50,"Stayed at this hotel due to it's convenient location, but would certainly return as the rooms were well equiped, spacious and well maintained. Breakfast was good, as was the gym and pool area. Well and truly 5 stars, and service at all levels very good. Bedding, including pillows, was exceptionally comfortable - all made for a good nights sleep."
574,April 2013,Couldn't be beat!,NA,50,"This is by far the greatest place I have ever stayed - I couldn't even open a door myself without the really helpful staff coming to my aid! Not that I needed it and after staying there a month it became more of a game!  Food was fantastic and the facilities brilliant. Could get a quick gym set and swim in daily - if I had the chance to I would book in here again. They have drivers on hand, central location that all taxis know and the staff from the hotel will even back you against outside taxis to make sure you have all your stuff and that you pay a fare price.   Flat screen TV even in your bath tub now thats luxury!"
575,February 2014,In the Center at Home in Manila,NA,40,"A true place for business visitors feeling home an large rooms with all effective things a business person needs to operate efficiently. Good reception desk staff, great breakfast!  It would be good of the management could make staff in the restaurant more aware to be alert and service oriented. So often I could not find anyone to help. They are slow. Must change as it does not fit the entire image.  The place is a bit boring as there is no bar where you can enjoy a drink; yes, you can have a drink, but that is in the same place where you have breakfast, lunch or dinner. Talking about dinner, the service is too slow.  A great place to be and nearby shopping males, the Asian Development Bank, several government and corporate offices in the area. Relatively easy to get to the"
576,February 2014,Service Excellence!,NA,50,"I stayed at the Oakwood Premier Joy-Nostalg for one week and my experience was fantastic. The staff were all very well presented and courteous, they were always available to answer any questions and would always greet you - I was even known by name towards the end of my stay.  The hotel itself was very clean and comfortable, the rooms are very spacious and luxurious. The fitness facilities are great and the pool is very inviting. The massage centre also offer many different treatments at affordable prices. The dining experience was also wonderful with a great menu and wonderful staff. I would highly recommend staying here if you are planning on visiting Manila. The hotel is within walking distance to shopping malls and restaurants."
577,February 2014,Nice clean Hotel,NA,50,"we spent 2 days at te hotel the rooms was clean and nice and especialy the breakfast was  great we enjoyed it a lot i can highly recomend this hotel at makati ,nice staf higly secured hotel and it very near to the Shoping malls and near it there is a 7 eleven store and its very safe even at night you will like it,"
578,February 2014,Very professional,NA,50,"We spent 3 nights in Oakwood and it was a very good experience regarding all aspect as staff, service, restaurant.A bit to far from airport and center but worse it for the quality of this hotel.We stayed in 2 bedrooms appartment and it was very clean and well organize.Airport transfert expensive as breakfast."
579,January 2014,Disappointed,NA,20,"My last night of my Philippines vacation was at the Oakwood Premier Joy Hotel. The price is not cheap to stay here, but I justified that I needed a more luxury and comfortable experience at a hotel before I have my long flight home. I'd have to say, there were too many things that went wrong on my stay to consider this a luxury hotel. I would not rate the hotel as a ""terrible"" rating because our room (minus the cockroaches) was nice, but with all of the things that went wrong on our stay, I feel the hotel deserves a ""poor"" rating.  Breakfast - We were told breakfast was 1000 pesos per person when we checked in, but when we got the bill the next morning, it was 1350 per person.  Pedicure/Manicure - The night before, we scheduled a manicure for 3 people in the morning. The next"
580,January 2014,just what you need,NA,50,"what made it all worth it is i bought a membership from the hotel. with the hotel membership voucher; i got a 1 bedroom suite for php4,000 a night.  what i live about oakwood is that it's complete. theres a kitchen. you can cook (complete equipment utensils dishes ground coffee beans etc; there's even an oven; a huge ref,etc.), wash clothes (washing machine with dryer in room), etc. it's spacious too.   for the 1-bedroom, there is a living room with tv and dining area.  the c.r. has sauna and its own Cable TV. cool! it just lacks a bidet.  for the 1 bedroom, the cr has an additional bathtub and another sink.  there's free internet too. and free parking for one car.   it's near podium (a mall), a 7-11 is just nearby.   the 5th floor has an indoor swimming pool, massage room,"

Is equipped kitchen appliance and washing machine for entertainment their is two flat screen tv with dvd player (one in the living room another one in the bed room) and another tv in the bathroom. Housekeeping personnel were very friendly and helpful they even help us on how to use some of appliance. The hotel is located near several shopping mall like Podium and Robinson mall while SM megamall and Shangri la plaza mall is still with in walking distance.

583,November 2013,Home Away From Home,NA,50,"Stayed here with the family for two weeks during our last trip to Manila.  We stayed in a three bedroom suite.  We loved the breakfast buffet, which we had almost everyday.  Their staff is also friendly.  The suites are very spacious and we also made use of the gym.  There were some misses:  - The design of my bathroom:  the water seeped through the glass door every time I had a shower. - The pool: It's indoor and 90 degrees Fahrenheit.  Really, who needs that in Manila?  Overall, we loved our stay.  My niece, Allie, was fond of all the breakfast staff, especially Bruce and Kelvin.  We're looking forward to staying here again during our next visit to Manila."
584,November 2013,"All you need in a hotel and more, an absolute JOY.",NA,50,"Oakwood Premier Joy-Nostalg Center Manila  After staying at over half a dozen different hotels in the Metro Manila area, I can now say I have now found the hotel where i'll staying for all my future trips. This dream of a hotel is exactly what myself and my fiance have been looking for, for over 5 years.  The pictures on their website don’t really give it justice. We were given a free upgrade to a 2 bed Suite which was absolutely massive, with a giant bed in the main room and 2 doubles beds in the guest room. The beds and pillows were so sumptuous. All the rooms have a fully functional kitchen with all the appliances you have at home, microwave, washing machine, dishwasher, massive fridge freezer, cooker oven & hob, cutlery pots and pans etc....

585,December 2013,elegant & spacious,NA,50,"gave it 5 stars because it's the most spacious and elegant residence i've got the pleasure to stay at so far. the room is clean and well-maintained. all the amenities you'd expect in a well-kept and modern home is complete here i.e. automatic washing machine, toaster, micro oven, big fridge, coffee maker, dishwasher. it even had an iron and board. what makes it truly exceptional is the 3 flat screens installed in 3 diff areas of the unit (living room/lounge, bedroom and bathroom), the  iPod dock and last but not the least the sound bar.   check-in was a breeze (at 7pm). lobby is small but it's not a five star hotel so i guess it doesn't have to compare. local calls are not free (and there's no indication that it's not). price is steep but it compensated with the amenities and"
586,November 2013,Absolutely lovely,NA,50,"These serviced appartments are very nice indeed.  Excellent for travellers or indeed expats whilst waiting to settle.  An amazing piece of luxury.  The reception staff are very helpful and friendly.  Breakfast was a delight, very good service and of course with a smile by the Filipino staff.  My room was so comfortable with a bathroom to die for!"
587,August 2013,Great place to stay.,NA,50,"Stayed at this hotel for the last three months.  My overall experience was fantastic. I never had a problem with staff. I was always treated very well. The bedding is great and the bathrooms are big and clean. It was conveniently located to the Metrowalk for some weekend fun. Had the chance to make some great friends in the building. The only thing I would fix would bethe spa. It was small and  the nail girls aren't given a nail table to work from. Overall. Though,it was a great time."
588,December 2013,"Service, staff ruined everything.",NA,20,"Dreadful staff that it didn't matter that my 2bed suite was spacious, nice bed, bathroom was fine (except for cheap toiletries). Overall unenthusiastic attitude and absolute incompetence. Call reception or service number always took at least 10 rings before they pick up. The voice on the other line almost always sounds unenthused to cater to your requests. Day 1 WIFI was down and when it got back it was unstable.   I asked for extra wine glasses and plates since I was entertaining 10 people over lunch and was told they can only 'loan' me 2 plates and wine glasses at most and the more than that they have to charge. What the ?!  Don't even bother going to the spa, big joke. Horrid tasteless dance music in the pool area ruining any chance to relax.  Housekeeping came in, started"
589,November 2013,one of the best places to stay in Ortigas,NA,50,"I chose to stay in this hotel while attending a conference held in a nearby hotel to experience living here.  I did not regret choosing to stay here. The amenities are excellent.  The best part is the buffet breakfast. In the 3 nights that I stayed here, there is no day with the breakfast menu similar to the previous day, the food were always different everyday. And the food taste great. The staff were also very friendly and helpful. They go all the way to help the guests.  The location is also perfect, just a few minutes walk to 3 big malls in Ortigas. I will stay here again. Mabuhay!"
590,November 2013,Double Lock Your Doors!!!,NA,20,"Check in was uneventful; it took long and we were able to check in at 3 pm.  Rooms were nice.   Around 11:30 pm, we woke up to the sound of someone trying to enter with a key card.  It sounded like the key card was okay (meaning electronically it was going through) except the door was double locked so the person kept on trying and trying. Around the 5th try, he rang the doorbell!!! My husband didn't open the door and just peeped and asked the person what room he has trying to enter. I then dialed '0' and reported it. The person behind the door left. At around 12 MN we were awakened yet again this time by the phone ringing. The person I spoke with earlier called to say that it was okay now and the person trying to enter just had to get something from his car in the basement."
591,November 2013,Great hotel,NA,50,Very international hotel in Manila close to the businesses. Stayed there for a week and enjoyed. Room service is great and prompt. Food is good. Great spread at breakfast. Very prompt taxi service to and from the airport. Best part was walking distance to the office. Has a decent swimming pool. The best part was the fully equipped kitched in the studio.
592,October 2013,Business Trip…,NA,40,"I have stayed at the hotel for 4 weeks while on a business trip In manila. The service that was provided by the staff was great, always willing to help.

I cannot say enough great things about the staff and service at Oakwood!  The breakfast staff are very attentive and remembered my preferred beverages and meals from day to day. The front desk staff are very personable and became friends over my two month stay. They genuinely wanted to help in any way possible and were very accomodating. The rooms are always clean and well serviced.  The apartments are spacious and very comfortable.  Location is great! Close to several malls, restaurants, nightlife and markets. You can walk to anything you would possibly need. Felt very safe walking around by myself with the level of security in Ortigas.  My only complaint is that I was sleeping during the"
594,November 2013,Awesome Home-Like Rooms!,NA,40,"It was my first time in this hotel, curious as I was about the rave reviews. I checked-in at Room 1808 last Saturday, November 16 for a one-night stay. As expected, I discovered for myself the 'lavishly-appointed' room (in my case, the studio room) with its elegant interior and complete facilities. Now, for the details:  DOWNSIDE: 1. The Check-In Time is 3PM which means guests like me have a 1 hour shorter stay compared to all other hotels that peg their standard check in time at 2pm. When I asked the Asst. Revenue Manager Ms. Chat Remegio, who also confirmed my prior booking, why this is so, she reasoned out that ""our lead in category is almost double the size of the standard room of other hotels. Thus, the standard check in time was adjusted to 3PM also to give ample time for"
595,November 2013,One of my favourite hotels,NA,50,"My husband and I have no complaints for this hotel. We stayed in a studio suite- immaculately clean, spacious and very beautiful. We loved the floor to ceiling windows, full kitchen, comfortable beds and steam room/shower. The fitness room was also very nice- lots of equipment, machines and several treadmills. Great location!"
596,August 2013,pleasant stay,NA,40,we stayed here for an overnight stay since my best friend gave a voucher for our anniversary gift to us. what can i say....very nice room though we only got the standard room. it small but very complete from kitchen bedroom and bathroom.....comfy bed and pillows. we have a mini sauna and a mini kitchen.....but what i like in this hotel is the pool....its very clean..... Im surely gonna be back here in this hotel....
597,March 2013,great stay!,NA,50,i would say that the times i spent at oakwood premier joy-nostalg center manila were great! ... very comfortable and homey and a place that you would like to come back to with your family and friends ....
598,October 2013,Always A Pleasant Stay,NA,40,"This is my first review of this hotel/serviced residence , although i have stayed here several times since it opened . It was always a pleasant experience, the spacious elegant one bedroom suite making it comfortable for weekend stays or during convention periods . The location is quite strategic , or central , but that depends on the circumstance of the stay . Security is tight as well , and every point going to your room is needs to be access by a key card . It is a short walking distance to the Podium, and several more steps would lead to a series of restaurant outlets  , and the SM Mega Mall . Included in my hotel package was free internet access , but no complimentary breakfast . We had brunch buffet at their Oakroom restaurant , which were offered at discounted rates for"
599,September 2013,Good Business Hotel - Food Needs Work,NA,30,"Room and common areas were very nice with beautiful decor and modern appliances.  Room was well set up for the business traveler.  Stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment that was nearly as large as my 2 bedroom apartment in New York!  Hotel was conveniently located within Pasig City to access nearby offices and malls.  My biggest complaint was the food.  Breakfast was pretty good, but both dinner experiences were awful.  Everything is presented well and whatnot, but the food itself tastes bad.  I mean, how do you screw up spaghetti and tomato sauce?  Apparently it's possible.  I ordered something different off the menu through room service the 2nd night and hedged my order with a piece of chocolate cake - just in case things turned out as bad as last night I could just eat the cake. "
600,September 2013,business trip,NA,50,"if you are looking for an excellent hotel at reasonable price during your business stay in the Philippines, you cannot get better than Oakwood Premier.  Rooms are spacious and clean with all necessary services.  Internet link is perfect and good for multiple devices. The staff is very courteous and helpful.  Your daily rate will most probably include breakfast which has all you desire to star your day.  Be it for breakfast, lunch or dinner the food is great and should you use room service, it is fast and efficient.  Although there is not much to do in the surroundings, there is a major shopping mall about 10 minutes away (walking distance).. "
601,August 2013,misleading info on website,NA,30,"place & room is excellent. website says wifi is free but it's not. thought valet was free too, but it was not. i thought kids below 7 was free including the breakfast but apparently only the room stay was free and for 3 year old, breakfast was billed 50%. wouldnt have minded it if it was declared early on as such. it also took so looong to check in. i thought check out  was at 12 noon. but we were only able to enter the room at past 3pm. superb facilities but guest service was poor..."
602,October 2013,Superb,NA,50,"I had meetings at the ADB and was booked into the Oakwood.  Having never stayed here before I had no idea what to expect and didn't have time to check reviews beforehand. I literally couldn't believe the spacious accommodations when I walked into my room.  Make that ""rooms"" because it consisted of a large sitting/dining room, kitchenette, large bedroom, and a sizable bathroom.  If you've spent enough time in hotels looking at rooms with ""four walls and a door"", this was enough to make you laugh out loud or cry with joy.    All of the rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, with quality furniture, appliances, electronics, bathroom fixtures, etc.  Floor to ceiling windows bring in lots of natural light and artificial lighting, which can often be weak or poor in hotel rooms, is"
603,June 2013,Restful Stay at Oakwood Premier,NA,40,"The staff were very friendly and would do everything asked of them in a friendly and timely manner. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Pasig. I felt safe, welcome and the food was good also.  D Watson. Australia."
604,October 2013,Best Bridal shower,NA,50,Had my surprise bridal shower there. Rooms were clean and comfortable to stay with. They had all the amenities we need inside and outside the hotel. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite and its big enough for us. 
605,July 2013,Most pleasant stay,NA,50,"My stay of fifteen days was a great experience because of the friendly hotel staff who were very helpful with:  first time visitor to the Philippines questions, advice on dining and shopping as well as sight seeing.  The entire hotel was spotless and each area (gym, bar, restaurant, lobby and the outstanding room) was above my expectations.   Specifically, the gym was a great finish to a busy day with perfect workout equipment for cardio and weight training.  The pool allowed for a great series of laps and the staff was most helpful with demonstrating equipment I was unfamiliar with. The location of the hotel allowed for ease of movement throughout the metro Manila area."
606,July 2013,"AMAZING HOTEL, AMAZING STAFF",NA,50,I could not recommend this hotel more highly. Great location between 3 large shopping centres. Staff are amazing people and make everyone feel very welcome :) I am definately looking forward to staying at the Joy-Nostalg centre when I return to Manila :)
607,September 2013,Amazing Place to Stay While in Manila,NA,50,Oakwood Premier is an excellent apartment hotel with will equipped & spacious apartments. Location is great & service is second to none. The kitchen amenities are of high quality & comprehensive. Additional amenities are always available.
608,September 2013,September 1 through Sept 8,NA,40,I was impressed with this hotel.  Very quiet as I had to sleep during the day and worked at night.  Service was very prompt and courteous.  Good value for the size room and conveinence.  Only complaint is that the bathroom lighting was dark and hard to see to put on makeup so I used the dining table.  I definiteyly will stay there again on my next visit.
609,September 2013,Excellant Hotel/ Studio Apartment,NA,50,"I arrive late on the 10th of September and was very tired from the travelling. The travel from the airport to the hotel was quite long due to rain and heavy traffic. However, everything turns out fine after the front desk did a really good job checking me in without any hiccups. They were fast and I like fast. hehe...  When i got to my room, A studio apartment at 23rd floor, it was a shocked as the room was tremendously nice and beautiful. It should be rated higher and the location itself in Pasig does not give the place justice. Evertyhing about the place is nice. The room is excellent and the staff is so attentive.  I had breakfast in the restaurant and the food was ok. Enough for breakfast although do not have so much choice. The price for the breakfast for me is a bit high"
610,November 2012,nice,NA,40,"my favourite place in Manila, not only because it is right opposite to my office, but also because of their generously appointed suites. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Food from room service could be better though. They have studio styled rooms, with well equipped kitchens. It's more of a well equipped apartment."
611,July 2013,so nice room,NA,40,"stayed for one day in this hotel for a conference. the room is big, nice smelling and with dish washer, washing machine ,an oven, a conduction cooker and a microwave. bathroom is clean and spacious. carpet is new. parking is okay and plenty. Breakfast needs a little improvement."
612,August 2013,Great stay,NA,50,"Stayed in the 1bed deluxe apartment, spacious, lots of ammenities. Made our stay VERY comfortable, very fast wifi, quiet rooms, would come back for sure. A couple small complaints here and there but the staff fixed them straight away."
613,August 2013,My 1 day staycation at this 5 star hotel!,NA,50,"I was skeptical about this hotel since I have not tried booking in any Oakwood hotels around the world and the not so friendly telephone inquiry response I got when I called before I finally made my booking.  The check in was also a bit un easy because of the parking but all of these were erased by the very cordial welcome of the Front Desk Staff ( missed her name ).  We were accorded a very polite and kind reception up to our room to which, upon entering, I was pleased to see the quiet elegance of the living room and dining with gorgeous fully equipped kitchen.  I said to myself I should have booked 3 nights to be able to cook and enjoy their hi tech kitchen appliances and wares.   The bedroom is private, large with an equally large toilet and bath with separate bath tub and"
614,June 2013,Fantastic rooms and service!,NA,50,"I have traditionally stuck to staying at the top 5-star hotel brands as I travel for work 2-3 nights every week. However, as I was travelling with my family and baby, we needed kitchen facilities and decided to stay at Oakwood during our recent trip to Manila. We got a two bedroom suite, which came with a generous living, dining and cooking area.  The rooms were just the right size that I did not knock into any furniture (as I frequently do in cramp places) while at the same time maintaining a cozy and warm feel. The interior of the rooms also showed clear attention to detail on the part of the hotel's designer. Lighting - variable control; Air conditioning - not blowing directly at my face when in the bed; Bathrooms - one of the largest I've seen with double sinks, a generous"
615,August 2013,"Good facilities, pleasant service",NA,40,"Good things: Well-equipped gym, decent (indoor) pool (though don't go for the view!), nice breakfast buffet spread, friendly and helpful service via room service and front desk.    Minor negatives: Noise - a bit of noise from the city/traffic gets into the room, air con and appliances also, but only a little. One staff member seemed to think it was an imposition that I came and asked her for a coffee after we failed to catch anyone's attention in the restaurant. The room service food was tasty but not quite as described.  Overall, those negatives were really minor things and, frankly, more here to show why I felt they didn't quite merit 5 stars."
616,August 2013,"Good quality amenities, clean rooms, warm efficient staff",NA,40,"Allow me to cut and paste a letter I sent to the hotel management   Oakwood Premier Joy~Nostalg Center Manila 17 ADB Avenue, Ortigas Center, Pasig City 1600, Philippines  To the Management,  Greetings!  My family stayed over the weekend of Aug 03-04 2013 occupying three (3) rooms to celebrate my daughter's birthday. [one one-bedroom and two studio suites]  The service, the warmth and efficiency of the staff are worth commending. Everything that we inquired and requested were promptly and professionally handled.  (There is one exception for the early check-in that we requested for one (1) room. A staff, I believe [will not mention for this purpose], confirmed over the phone that it was ready, only to find out when we got there that it wasn't yet. But the wait wasn't long).  I"
617,July 2013,Good choice for business,NA,30,"This isn't really a hotel, it's a tower of extended-stay executive apartments. There is a full kitchen and a washing machine in each apartment.  I stayed in a Studio which is the smallest unit. It was a big room but most of it was taken up by the kitchen which I never used. It was 7116 Pesos per night including breakfast about EUR 125  Impressively equipped with rice cooker, fridge/freezer, coffee maker, oven, microwave. It seemed a shame not to use it, but I wasn't there long enough.  There's a lovely long & narrow pool on 6th floor perfect for a workout and a fitness centre on floor above. Great massages at very reasonable prices too.   Staff are very friendly and eager to help as I found everyone in Manila to be.   Hotel restaurant was OK. Nothing special, there are better"
618,May 2013,Nice staycation,NA,40,"Room was nice. Location is accessible and very near malls and other establishment. Pool was ok. Only problem was the online promotion was not clear. I booked thru their website wanting to avail of a promo, however, turned out not everything was written on the website. I should have just booked thru agoda instead and earned some points."
619,April 2013,Majestic!!,NA,50,One of the greatest experience in my life. It was a superb place to be around. Wish i could go back and stay there for another few days but this time with my newly wed Wife. All the services and atmosphere around was just superb. Did not find anything to complain actually. Its a great place to be.
620,May 2013,Great Business Hotel,NA,50,"This was my second stay at the Oakwood Premier  Joy-Nostalg Center Hotel in Manila .  Both visits were truly enjoyable and I look forward to the opportunity to return. This is a first class hotel and a great place to stay on business. The rooms are big, very clean and comfortable and the staff makes every attempt to please. The location is central for business visits, shopping and eating.  I really can't find any fault with the hotel. This is now my first choice of hotels in Manila; and the other 4 business partners in my group felt the same..  "
621,May 2013,Great stay.,NA,50,It's a great stay. The rooms are luxurious and classy. The bedroom and the toilets are opulent. Swimming pool and play room amenities are so enjoyable for my kids. They  are beyond our expectations. We plan to come back for another family getaway.
622,May 2013,Well-appointed and comfortable stay,NA,40,I stayed at Oakwood Premier last May for a week-long business trip.  The room was clean and had a luxurious feel to it.  I personally felt the room was too huge for a business traveler.  The kitchen was complete and good for long-staying guests.  I didn't have to cook though as there are many good dining options around the hotel.  The breakfast spread was good and the atmosphere suggests that the hotel is targetting business travelers rather than holidaying families or tourists.  That's probably a given considering its location right across the Asian Development Bank.  I would definitely stay here once more in my future business trips.
623,June 2013,Another Great Experience,NA,50,"Once again, the staff and accommodations exceeded my expectations!  Check-in/out was fast and efficient and housekeeping was thorough. The Oakroom/bar are always my favorite experiences...the staff is extremely courteous and makes dining an enjoyable experience.  This establishment is truly my home away from home!"
624,July 2013,overnight stay,NA,40,"Room was big, nice and clean. It is in fact better than a lot of 5 star hotels. Our only complaint is the breakfast buffet. It was not very good. We felt the price was not justified. Room service [food] however was good."
625,May 2013,Oakwood -- A Most Unforgettable Place to Stay,NA,50,"There are four persons in our group:  my husband, Danilo, his brother Romy -- who is a doctor in St. Louis, MO and his wife, Lea, and me.  My daughter also came and stayed one night.  The purpose of our visit is to bury my motherin-law who lives in Quezon City.  Because we stayed at the Oakwood/Ascott in Makati during one of our Manila vacations where we find that hotel absolutely 5 star in all levels, we decided to stay at this Oakwood, considering that this hotel is halfway to Quezon City and Manila traffic leaves something to be desired.  As can be expected, we were not disappointed:  the staff, service, and value is top shelf.  We usually stay at one of the Makati hotels when we visit the Philippines but if we find ourselves looking for a hotel in the Mandaluyong/Pasig area"
626,June 2013,1st Time International Traveler,NA,50,This was the first time I have traveled out of the country and the Oakwood Hotel was terrific!  They answered all of the questions I had and they made sure we had everything we needed.  The rooms were like apartments and they were huge.  The house keeping put two bottles of water in my room daily and made sure we had everything we needed.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  I slept very good even though it was a 12 hour time difference.  I would definetely recommend this hotel and I would definetely stay there again.  The staff was always professional and very nice.  The bar staff was extremely nice and made me feel very comfortable and enjoyed the little bit of time I had to go down there.
627,May 2013,Excellent rooms,NA,50,"I stayed at this hotel for business, and ended up using the lounge for running my team training as the office Air con went on the blink. The Plasma screens were easy to connect my PC. Overall the standard of the rooms is very high as are the guest relations. They were quick to address a couple of minor technical issues. Excellent work !"
628,July 2013,Stayed @ a 2-bedroom suite with Family on Birthday,NA,30,"Disappointed with service, especially with the pool attendant. It seems that he's not happy with his job and does not know how to accommodate & welcome incoming guests. The room is fantastic in size, fully furnished and the set up is cozy & comfortable, you may not want to go out of the room anymore, you can opt to watch cable TV or DVD or even get a very relaxing steam bath inside the shower. The hotel building and its amenities are great. The staff failed in giving friendly & professional service"
629,February 2013,Excellent service,NA,50,"Excellent service and kindly people. Rooms are perfect to stay for a long time; clean, comfortable, complete kitchen, etc...   Excellent location near the business district, Ortigas. I recomend it, of course"
630,April 2013,A marvelous experience,NA,50,"I have to reckon that, even used to business travels as I am, the standard hotel I am used to is just that... 'standard'. Oakwood was a complete, marvelous surprise, not only for the incredibly wide room, with an amazing set of facilities, but for the quality of the funiture and materials. I was delighted by the WiFi high speed connection, that allowed me remote working as comfortably as I were at home... or even at office. So geek as I am, I found an endless source of enjoy the three LED TVs available, and specially the Samsung Sound Bar attached to the TV at the main room. Room service was fast and efficient, I only had a problem (with the TV remote control) that was solved in a couple of minutes. The breakfast buffet was plenty of high quality dishes, with a really"
631,July 2013,R&R,NA,40,"This is my fourth time to stay in this hotel. As always room was nice, Spacious and has everything we need for cooking, bath etc. Perfect for small intimate parties with friends and or family. Reception staff are now smiling and accomodating compared to my previous experiences with the reception staff of Oakwood. I am very particular with the friendliness of the people behind the reception desk as they are the frontliners of the hotel. All the great amenities of the place will just go to waste if staff are rude or would not even give the guest the simple gesture of smiling. I hope you can work on the staff at the restaurant. we always avail of the breakfast buffet as food is always exceptional but it is very hard to make requests nor get the attention of the restaurant crew"
632,April 2013,2nd stay in the hotel,NA,50,"This was my second stay at the hotel, I was very lucky on my first stay which happened when most rooms were fully booked. I got promoted to bigger room.  The hotel is nice and clean, it looks more like a serviced appartment with all complete cooking utensils.  I'm hoping that they provide compass in each room so that it'd be easier for a Muslim to find direction to pray, and information on the buffet whether the food contains pork product or not.  I haven't have the chance to stay at any other office in Manila, so not sure if it's the best service in the country.  I can say that there are hotels in different countries in Asia with better, friendlier, and warmer services."
633,March 2013,Room service,NA,50,"Room service needs a little bit of improvement. A brochure on operating washing machine, oven etc. would be great help. As some of the brand are not known worldwide so operating the machine is a bit challenging and at times confusing. Try to use more renowned brands like-samsung, LG, etc. whose operations are a bit known across various countries.  Try to provide more options like TV channels, and introduction of online movies viewing like HULU plus, etc."
634,April 2013,Super Stay at Oakwood Premiere,NA,50,"Hi,  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Oakwood Premier (Phillipines). The rooms are spacious, contemporary and provides all comforts of a 5 star place. They are actually better than many 5 star properties.   This will continue to remain my preferred place of stay while I am in Manila. Cheers!!  Bhavesh Antani"
635,May 2013,Super Service - and beautiful appartements,NA,50,"I stayed 5 weeks in the Oakwood in Ortigas and I have nothing but only good expierences.  The area (Ortigas) although considered a nice area in Manila it is not a pretty area. But to make up for this the hotel. is surrounded by 5 shopping malls. The Upscale malls like Shangri-la and The Podium or bargain hunters paradise St.Francis Mall or the mega sm megamall. The breakfast of the oakwood is their only flaw, I did not like anything on the buffet but the staff they all they could to make it better for me. My one bedroom appartement was a dream with a free standing tube with TV and a steamroom in the Bathroom made the appartement the most beautiful I have ever stayed in.  But the true success of the Oakwood is their incredible attentive staff. Reception, doormen, restaurant"
636,June 2013,Too expensive,NA,40,"The room on the 28th floor is absolutely fantastic. Nice view. Big space for  2 bedrooms, kitchen, dining area and a living area. But for a hefty price, they should include free wifi. If you want wifi,  you need to pay P300 per hour. Location wise, it is very near 3 different malls, there is a church and hospital nearby."

This is a great Value Hotel, with unsurpassed friendly service , and a nice indoor pool and Gym area. Breakfast is pretty good, NOT amazing but will fill you up for the day ahead. Its very close to other restaurants (walking distance - 5-6 Mins), however the in room menu is not bad and quite cheap. 2 entrances to the property, both with 24 Security and 24Hr Reception.

638,June 2013,needs wifi,NA,50,"Centrally located to Robinson Mall and Podium mall and a short walk (through Podium) to the Megamall as well. Staff very professional and friendly. Great rooms, gym, pool, sauna also great. Biggest let down is cost of wifi. Otherwise very little complaint!"
639,May 2013,I wish all hotels are as comfortable,NA,40,"The room is excellent. All the furniture, appliances, fixtures, washroom amenities, etc. are absolutely nice. Only thing missing is wi-fi. For P16,000/night you'ld expect complimentary wi-fi is already included. All in all though, it was a remarkable hotel experience."
640,March 2013,World Class,NA,50,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels and this one is right up there with the best, on every level. I believe the hotel is marketed more towards business people as it shares the same building as a business center however I stayed here, on my own visiting family as a holiday. The staff couldn't have been more friendly, my room attendant, Alain was so lovely and welcoming. The room was beautifully appointed and had everything you would expect in a high end hotel, it also had a full kitchen which was fantastic for longer stays when you would like to eat in and prepare your own meals.  The area is, I believe, a good one. It's not right in the CBD of Manila but it had everything I needed including some huge shopping malls (in particular SM Megamall). I walked to it quite often on my own"
641,February 2013,satisfied,NA,40,no complaints staff was very friendly look forward to staying with Oakwood again this summer I appreciated the car service and never had to wait for a vehicle would defintiely reccomend Oakwood to other business travellers.

This is the finest Hotel I have stayed at during me extensive travel through Asia in the last five years. The room's and facilities provided were excellent, large comfortable and well appointed. The room provided for all my needs during this stay and I look forward to returning."
643,March 2013,Good,NA,50,Smoking Facility was not available in the room....Apart from this everything is awesome....  More Indian Food Should be available.... Swimming Pool Was very Small. Customer Service was Good. Likes The cab facility provided by the hotel.

645,March 2013,Experience with Oakwood,NA,40,"I had an overnight stay at Oakwood with my husband and my son.  The entire experience would have been great except for the deceptive voucher that they have.  Weeks before our scheduled check in time, I called the hotel to make the reservation and clarified our voucher for an overnight stay at the hotel's studio room.  The FO who took the call said that there was nothing to pay except for the P2,000 deposit which was refundable, and also mentioned that we needed to pay for the deposit.   Since I don't use a credit card, I offered to pass by personally to give the 2,000 deposit, and so I went there with my family to give the money.  But when we were there, the FO said that we can make the deposit upon check in, then again I double checked the voucher, and again the FO said that"

647,January 2013,Canadian traveller,NA,50,"I tried other places down the street but came back to Oakwood. The entire package is fabulous including the staff, the room and proximity to shopping and other places to go. If there is one downside it's the slow drive between the airport and the hotel due to traffic but I would keep going back."
648,March 2013,Spacious one bedroom apartment,NA,30,"My parents won a stay at this hotel from a raffle.  Chose to stay during Holy Week, unfortunately the hotel was packed with guests since they had a deal grocer promo at the same time.  The small lobby was full and guests were seated on the floor along with scattered luggage. The good thing is that their front office processed guests very quickly.   The indoor pool was convenient since we didn't have to worry about sunburn, but with 50 guests availing of deal grocer coupons, the pool was packed to the brim.  No space to even leave towels.   I was very impressed with the size and design of the room. It was a fully furnished one bedroom apartment complete with dishes, pots, full size refrigerator, washer/dryer, and dishwasher. Very spacious. The bathroom has his and hers sinks and"
649,March 2013,Nice Hotel....,NA,40,The hotel is very well run and very well located....I would prefer an outdoor area to lounge in.....like the Shangri La hotel....an outdoor pool is ideal....I didnt go swimming once as when Im in a tropical country...I want to swim outdoors.  Overall an excellent hotel.
650,February 2013,Excellent,NA,50,"The hotel is fabulous and has everything one needs, both for a business traveller and for a leisure stay. The personnel was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great and with a wide selection. Anytime I travel to our office in Manila I would stay at this hotel."
651,April 2013,Home Away from Home,NA,50,"After a tiring flight to Manila and a 120 minute drive from the airport to the hotel in peak traffic, the best thing that happened was checking into this hotel. It's a apartment room and hence had a living room, a kitchen & a bed room. All rooms were very spacious and hence made me feel at home.  You can write down your grocery list & leave it in the kitchen & the things are in the kitchen when you come back from work back to the room. The price difference is not that big but save you time & effort in doing your own shopping.  They provided me a wi-fi router within minutes from the time i placed a request to the front desk. This is just one example of how quick & effective their service was. The best service I have ever received in a business hotel. They do really care for the"
652,May 2012,love every decor,NA,40,"stayed here 2011.  as soon as we entered the room, we knew were in the right place.  i love their kitchen.  it is well organized and equipped with everything we need.  the living room is very spacious and have pretty decor.    the bedroom suite has a headboard that i would love to re-create in my house.  the room has 3 televisions: sala, bedroom and bathroom.  i used the bath tub like a modern cleopatra watching her favorite movie.  i was just annoyed when i asked my kid's yaya to accompany my toddler in  their playroom.  the staff said that it was still closed because the one assigned there has the key and she's nowhere to be found.  i could have given the perfect rating if they allowed my baby to play."
653,December 2012,"Big-sized rooms, great location",NA,30,"The one-bedroom suites are larger than your average hotel rooms. All rooms come equipped with a washer/dryer, an oven, a microwave oven, stove top and other kitchen amenities. The bathroom has a small television in front of the bathtub while the shower can also be used as a steam room. In as much as I like the room amenities, I could not help but notice that some of the bathroom tiles are already in need of replacement. The location can't be beat because you are just a stone's throw away from The Podium and a short walk from SM Megamall. This will allow guests to go shopping or eat out without having to bring their cars or take a cab. One negative thing that I experienced was regarding the parking. Unfortunately, this hotel only has limited parking slots for their guests since"
654,March 2013,Nice place for a longer stay,NA,40,"Very good for a longer stay. Oakwood location is excellent, short walk away from shopping and restaurants. Service was excellent and staff were very friendly and delivered with a smile. If you need anything, you get it immediately. Staff also remembers your name from day one. Breakfast was perfect for me, liked the fresh mangoes a lot. Room service menu was good, but started to get 'boring' after 8 days.  Swimming pool is nice, if there are not too many children in it. Fittness facilities are good as well.  Spa facilities and services were the only point to improve."
655,March 2013,"Amazing serviced apartment, great location for shops",NA,40,"I thought it was going to be a hotel room but it turned out to be a small apartment, with a kitchen, lounge, huge bedroom and bathroom. It was worth it for the bathroom - freestanding bath with TV, and steam room/shower and his and his or his and hers or hers and hers sinks.   I can't fault the apartment and breakfast buffet was great - lots of variety and quantity.   The gym was also well equipped, but I didn't try the pool.  The restaurant, as usual with hotels, was quiet and characterless at night. There is a separate bar which was smoky and more fun. Also happy hour, which is never a bad thing but ask when it is as they don't tell you or advertise it! The best option is bar then room service, amusingly called their ''Private Dining'' menu. Sounded suspicious but was actually"
656,March 2013,Excellent 3 day 2 night Holy Week Stay,NA,50,"Through Deal Grocer, we were able to get a good promo for a 3 day 2 night stay in Oakwood Premier.  We got a 1 bedroom suite that includes a fully functioning kitchen, with all the necessary utensils.  This allowed us to prepare our own meals, thus saving us some expenses.  Also since we checked in Good Friday where all restaurants are closed, we did not have to worry where to eat.  What made it even more pleasant was that the clean up of the room included taking care of all the dirty dishes. Mac, the guy that cleaned our room was exceptionally accommodating. We requested him to sweep the floor because the baby was still crawling, and what he did was wipe by hand the floor with a rug. That was very considerate of him.  The pool was great especially since it was heated. This made"
657,March 2013,Nice hotel with great staff!,NA,40,"From the time I was picked up from the airport to the time I was dropped off at the airport, the Oakwood staff were amazing! Nothing was ever an issue for them. I stayed in a 1-bedroom apartment. It's spacious with all the amenities. There were not many selection for breakfast. I stayed there for 8 nights so after day 5, I started going to cafes for breakfast. The gym is well equipped. There are several treadmills, bikes and cross trainers. There is a separate room for weight training. The indoor pool is great. There is also an in-house nurse which can come in very handy if you are there with kids. I was there on business so it was an ideal base for me. There are several malls within walking distance, SM Mega Mall, The Podium, Shangri-la Plaza Mall. I highly recommend this hotel"
658,March 2013,probably the best hotel in the world that I can afford to stay in.,NA,50,"If you don't need an amazing bar and club, really want a great room with fantastic service for a good price then this is the place for you, especially if you want to cook yourself.  The rooms are out of this world, so clean, got all the equipment you need plus more.  First hotel I ever stopped in with a washing machine and dishwasher.  The cleaner folded my clothes up everyday that I had dumped on the floor. The bathroom is huge and has a walk in shower and a monster bath.  Plus there is a nice indoor pool and a pretty good gym.  The bar is great if you want to relax with nobody bothering you.  Breakfast was great and included in the room price.  Finally the business centre was well equipped and you can get DVD's from their huge collection to watch on the two DVD players in your"
659,January 2013,Very Impressed with Service and Amenities!,NA,50,"I had heard hotels in Manila were a bit rough around the edges, and if that's the case, the Oakwood is a hidden gem. For the price, I can't imagine it can get any better than this. The hotel and room were both spotless and no amenity was overlooked. One of the most comfortable beds I've slept in with really nice sheets and pillows. The staff could not have been more helpful or accomodating - I was shocked to see a review stating otherwise. I was thoroughly impressed by the room which had a full kitchen, washer/dryer (modern and clean), and lovely bath room with a steam shower. Everything was in excellent working condition, including the steam shower which was impressive. Security at the hotel was also very good and the area surrounding the hotel is quite nice although I did not"
660,January 2013,NOT a good value for Money. Staff is not polite,NA,20,1. Rooms and equipments/amenities in the room are high class. 2. Service is not good 3. Hotel staff (including management)  is not so hospitable and courteous 4. Very expensive considering the above. In all not a good value for money
661,February 2013,Sad to leave!,NA,50,"Oakwood Premier is one of the best serviced apartments I have stayed at! It was upsetting to leave a place that felt like home to me. Checked into a massive two-bedroom apartment (with two bathrooms) complete with kitchen facilites (including an oven and dishwasher). Note that not all serviced apartments in Manila have such facilites so this was a plus-plus. Facilites were all excellent - pool, jacuzzi, spa, gym and even a play centre! Oakwood Premier makes a wonderful option for both long and short stays. I was sad to leave, but looking to return sometime soon."
662,December 2012,Excellent five-star accommodation,NA,50,"We were accorded excellent service from the time we checked-in; from the parking personnel, to the security officers, receptionist, and even the staff at the buffet breakfast area. They have an impressive spacious 1-bedroom suite, with all the things you need for your stay. The kitchen has an electric dishwasher, ceramic hob with range hood, a washing machine, microwave, and other usual household appliances. The bathroom has a steam room, bath tub with TV close at hand.   The hotel is very near malls such as The Podium, SM Megamall, Robinsons Galleria and Shangrila Mall. It is also only about 10 to 15 minutes away from Greenhills Shopping Center.  A few hundred steps away are a 7-11 convenience store, Anson's, and more restaurants, especially at the El Pueblo Complex. Aside from"

664,October 2012,Its always more fun in philippines,NA,50,"I stayed in Oakwood from 28-Oct-2012 to 15-Dec-2012. From the very first moment the tag line ""Its always more fun in philippines"" started becoming true. Humble, Courteous and awesomely helpful staff. Its actually feels home outside home in Oakwood. The location is so amazing we never had to guide the taxi driver to the place.. just say the name Oakwood in Ortigas...thats all u will be there. Whatever u need from restaurents, super markets, theatres or shopping mall..they are all there near Oakwood.  I stayed in 2BHK service apartment as well as studio apartment...both the accomodations are classy. The service offered by the House keeping people is just what one can desire. Thanks to our attendant ALLIAN, he was always there to service the apartment whenever we call him.  All i"
665,December 2012,Impressive,NA,50,"We were impressed with the whole package offered for our 1-night stay at Oakwood Premier Joy-Nostalgia Center. 1) Kitchen utilities, Dining utilities and even washing machine were completely provided 2) Room was very spacious for a group of 4 3) Receiving area (sala area) was very comfortable and theater set is complete for our pleasure 4) Bath tub was a plus! Bathroom facilities was amazing particularly the tv set in one of the bathroom 5) All staff who assisted were very accommodating, courteous and polite during our entire stay  I am definitely going back to this hotel. Will recommend to friends, too."
666,November 2012,Excellent,NA,50,"I loved the place, the staff memebers were very professional and very customer oriented.  The rooms / suites felt like home....  I also liked the area, close to Malls, restaurants, night life, movie theaters....  I would recomend Oakwood to my collegues without a doubt... "
667,September 2012,5 Week Stay,NA,50,I am so glad I have this opportunity to reply.  I had intended on writting a letter when I returned to home to the United States but time got away from me.  I stayed for 5 weeks at the Oakwood and have to say that I could not have asked for a better experience.  Having travel many times over the years I have never experienced a more prefessional yet warm and friendly staff.  5 weeks is a long time to be away from home but they made it feel like a second home. Any request or need was immediately met (with a smile).  I apologize but my memory is poor when it comes to names but my room attendant was Alaine? He was eager to care for my needs and added that personal touch.  Your restaurant staff were wonderful. I actually looked forward to eating at the hotel which is a switch for
668,October 2012,Great Family Staycation!,NA,50,"Our staycation in Oakwood was very memorable and my family enjoyed it a lot. Oakwood has very spacious and clean rooms with breathtaking view of the metro. The room interior particularly the pieces of furniture and equipment are very well-maintained and sophisticated. In addition, the service is very good and commendable.  Location is not a problem because it is very accessible. In fact, there are lots of shopping malls around like SM Megamall, Robinsons Galleria and Podium.        Your family will surely enjoy the comfort Oakwood offers."
669,January 2013,NIce but a few Niggles,NA,40,"Tried for an early check-in at 10am and they did offer a smoking room by 11:30 (declined) They finally had a non smoking room cleaned for us at 13:50 but as check-in is officially at 14:00 that was still early. The first room was so close to very heavy construction and directly overlooked an adjacent building site (within 15m) that we asked to be moved to the other side of the building. They allowed us to stay in our first room, then called us an hour later for the transfer. The next apartment was significantly quieter yet still overlooked a building site, albeit some distance away. First impressions were good, luxuriously furnished, very spacious apartment with a nice modern kitchen and bathrooms. Windows are double glazed (a rarity in Manila). Maintenance is little lacking in"
670,November 2012,friendly,NA,50,"From the time you walk in; guards at front, bell boy, front desk, housekeepers, Avis drivers/staff and Restaurants staffs, welcomes me with a smile, treat me as family members, very respectable staffs and housekeeper Marlon maintains the cleanliness of my room in a daily basis. I will recommend your place to my friends and the Filipino association here in Cincinnati, Ohio."
671,December 2012,11/16-12/21/2012 stay,NA,40,"Overall the service was good with a few concerns. My last week (of 5 weeks) there, the cleanliness of the room was not as good as the first weeks. The folks that cleaned the room proceeded to do less and every day I would come in and find something that was not completed. For example one day the garbage was not emptied and the next I came back from work and there were towels on the ground.  I accidentally dropped something that rolled under the bed and realized that there were a lot of goose feathers and dust under the bed. This was not good as I am allergic to goose feathers and the hotel knew this before I got there which explained why my allergies were so bad.  I was discouraged to find out that they were intiating a reqards program for frequent guests in January when I had"
672,November 2012,"Best choice for a longer stay in Ortigas, Manila",NA,50,"You can't beat the Oakwood for stays of a week or more. Very good, well-appointed suites, with great cooking facilities and washer-dryer. Superb, consistently competent and friendly service (which is a hallmark of the Philippines). Located just acroos the street from ADB, it was perfect for my work. And a wide range of shopping, dining and entertainment within a 5-10 minute walk. The daily breakfast buffet is excellent with lots of variety. So, all in all, an excellent value. Jay-R, my daily room attendant, has been wonderful in my long stays (1-2 months) over the past two years. The beds are very comfortable, but there is construction noise outside from the rapidly developing Ortigas area, so light sleepers may want to request the ""quiet side."" I did not use the gym facilities,"
673,December 2012,Oakwood Premier Joy Nostalg Center means service excellence,NA,50,"I visit Manila once a quarter and make it a point to stay at Oakwood Premier Joy Nostalg Center. From the doorman to bell hop to guest relations manager to front desk officers to housekeeping associates to restaurant associates to spa therapists to managers - each and every one is service excellence personified. In this place, it is difficult to single out any one person or service that stands out. Courtesy, politeness, friendliness, smiles and service is everywhere. The location of this property is its greatest advantage - close to shopping, entertainment, public transportation and not too far away from the airport. For a solo traveller, their studio suite is very adequate in every respect. The One-Bedroom suite is a marvel. Their breakfast spread is very good and caters to"
674,January 2013,Luxurious stay with all the comforts of home,NA,50,"My daughter suggested that instead of having a birthday party, she would like to spend a night in a hotel.  I came across Oakwood Joy-Nostalg through Deal Grocer and thought that the overnight stay at the 2-Bedroom suite with breakfast for 4 would be perfect for the occasion.  We were not disappointed and I think I have just raised the bar for my children's expectations for our staycations.  The Oakwood Joy-Nostalg is like a cross between a luxury 5 star hotel and a serviced apartment intended for long staying guests.  You have the luxurious feeling that you get from a 5 star hotel and at the same time, you have everything you need as you would have at home.    Regular check in time is at 3:00PM.  The reason for this is that it takes longer for them to clean and prepare the room"
675,December 2012,Oakwood escape,NA,50,"We are 3 adults in a 1-bedroom suite. It fits us just fine.  We were checked-in right away even before check-in time.  The room is complete with almost everything you need.  There is ironing board and iron.  Kitchen utensils and appliances are complete.  You just need to make a grocery or bring food to cook.  You can cook breakfast, lunch or dinner.  You can even bake.  Room is spacious.  Bathroom is magnificent.  All rooms (living room, bedroom, and toilet) have flat screen TVs, are comfortable and modern.  Swimming pool is great.  It is heated.  Staff are courteous and friendly.  The hotel is just a walking distance to a convenience store (7-11), and The Podium and St. Francis Square malls. Checking out is fast too.  Overall experience is great!  Good for a relaxing escape"
676,December 2012,Very comfortable and spacious hotel room,NA,50,"My family and I love this hotel and we go here for staycations. Staff are courteous and observe the guests privacy. The rooms are tastefully designed, the beds are very comfortable, the bathroom has its own tv and sauna."
677,December 2012,Breakfast buffet egg station.,NA,30,"We were having the buffet breakfast this morning when we heard a loud bang from the egg station part of the buffet spread.  Apparently there was a small gas explosion.  It was loud enough to scare little kids walking around.  Fortunately,  there was no one hurt except maybe the cook.  Perhaps an electric stove might be better suited next time or a cook who is not overworked from the night before.  I was with my kids and I can only imagine what would have happened if we were actually getting eggs at that time."
678,October 2012,Surreal and Luxurious,NA,50,"It was well-serviced suite where all your needs will be offered. From the properly managed security personnel, courteous but not equally friendly receptionists, adept electricians and polite bell boys; I deeply enjoyed my one night stay there.  First, when I called for reservations, all my requests were provided like floor no. and room view. I can't forget how they called me on my mobile at least 10x to secure all my pending wants. Second, there was high-end security. My belongings were checked from the parking up to the hotel lobby. Third, I like the idea of having all amenities and facilities there. The bed and sofas were all so comfy. The bath has sauna but I guess you need to put an adjacent mini shower or bidet sprayer for easy cleanup. It was well-ventilated and"
679,December 2012,Home away from home,NA,50,"I've read about Oakwood featured in a blog and was mesmerized with the amenities, also i wanted my children to experience the underwater music in their indoor pool. So when Deal Grocer offered a great 3D2N stay, i decided to try and experience a stay in Oakwood.   The hotel is a stone's throw away from the Podium mall and there's a Pure Gold grocery in St. Francis Square's basement so it's easy to shop for food or grocery items.   Oakwood is a serviced apartment, equipped with a washing machine so i was able to wash our clothes instead of bringing home worn clothes after our sort-of holiday in the city. I was also able to save on breakfast food since i could cook for the family, the kitchen that comes with our 1BR suite is fully equipped with utensils, pots and all. The only"
680,December 2012,Home away from home,NA,50,"I stayed at Oakwood just recently and I was and still am amazed by the spacious one bedroom suite that I booked, the kitchen is high tech and fully furnished and the bathroom is to die for. The bedroom is amazing and the receiving area is very big. The staff especially Ms. Lirraine from guest relation is so helpful and she was kind enough to accompany me and my husband to our suite. All staffs during our stay were courteous and very friendly. I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my friends and family. I am planning to book again soon :)"
681,November 2012,Business travel,NA,50,"Great hotel Good value in terms of room size and amenities in comparison with over-priced Makati hotel. Superb cleanliness and service. Only downside is that despite frequenting the hotel at least twice a month over last 3 years, there is no added ""bonus"" to loyalty. No free upgrade or no free nights. "
682,November 2012,"Spacious, luxury apartment hotel",NA,50,"I stayed at the Oakwood for three nights, sharing a twin room with a colleague. The apartment is very spacious and elegantly furnished. There is a fully equipped kitchen and option of ordering your groceries for the next day if you don't have time. I loved the bathroom with a TV and shower with an option of steam bath (although the buttons to control it should come with some manual). Breakfast offers a big choice of interesting foods, exotic fruit but also Asian and Indian dishes. I really like the restaurant and its service. The area seems OK, with a large mall just next door.  Wish they had some salt, pepper and sugar in the kitchen, makes no sense to buy this for a few days. Internet in the room worked on cable only."
683,November 2012,Oakwood is Love,NA,50,"I have been in many 5-star hotels in Manila, but nothing compares to Oakwood.  I have visited twice and the service and facilities have been topnotch for both times.  I don't know what bed and pillows they use, but they are the kind where you don't want to ever get up. Haha.  I also love cooking so I loved the kitchen and the fact that everything you need is within reach while you are within the stove area (ref,microwave,dishwasher, sink, cooking utensils etc).  Special thanks to Jake in reception who accommodated my late check-out request, to Benedict  (? I am not sure if this is his name) who swapped us to smoking rooms when we have failed to specify that on our reservation, to the housekeeping guy (I wish I have his name) who delivered the glass pitcher I requested and to the"
684,October 2012,An Extremely Comfortable Stay,NA,40,Upon Check-in was upgraded from an One Bedroom to a Two Bedroom.  I was also escorted my room by a member of the reception staff.  The rooms were extremely will appointed and maintained.  The room came with free wifi.   Extremely comfortable Bed and all quality amenities.     Ate Dinner at the Oakroom on the first day and breakfast one morning.  I was not too impressed with the restaurant and especially Breakfast as the Breakfast at EDSA Shangri-La is far superior to that at Oakroom.  My only gripe about the place would be that it was very quiet and did not have any character to the place.
685,November 2012,Love this hotel! Our family's favorite!,NA,50,We just love staying in Oakwood. Excellent customer service. Customer-focused in its truest form.  We've tried all the rooms from studio to deluxe room to one-bedroom to a three -bedroom. Very well maintained. Very thorough housekeeping staff!  Breakfast buffet selection is good enough for my kids. International selection includes Chinese and Indian food since Oakwood is just across Asian Development Bank.   Love the indoor swimming pool. Heated pool with music :) what more can you ask for?
686,October 2012,An excellent experience,NA,50,"I've stayed at the Oakwood about four or five times on business trips, and I rate it very highly. Rooms are excellent and spacious. They all come with a kitchenette and washing machine. On the last two stays I have been given a suite, which is probably the largest and best hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. I should mention that I was very pleased with 'standard' room on my earlier visits. In each case the beds were very comfortable, furnishing is to very high standard, bathrooms and showers were very good, large flat-screen TV, etc. In previous stays I have had to use cable internet, but last month the wifi worked in the room and the restaurant as well.   Breakfast is very good. There is a reasonable-sized buffet with a good array of western and Asian foods. I haven't ever"
687,November 2012,"Very comfortable. Wish I could live here, seriously.",NA,50,"We took a staycation over the Nov 1-3 break, thanks to a couple of 2-night, 1-BR suite coupons we bought on DealGrocer. When we checked in, they had just run out of 1-BR suites, so they offered to gives us a single 3-BR suite instead of the two 1-BRs, which sounded like quite a good deal.  The 3BR suite is a lavishly spacious and very comfortable apartment; the feeling is less five-star hotel, and more of an actual well-appointed, high-end condo apartment that one would absolutely love to live in permanently. Each room has its own bathroom (masters' had a sauna+shower and tub, the other two rooms just had the shower). TVs in two rooms plus the living room, and also INSIDE the masters bathroom in front of the tub.   Unit had a nice fully-functioning kitchen with a great ref,"
688,May 2012,Oakwood Hotel Review,NA,50,"Service and accomodations were excellent. I was there for an extended business stay from late May to mid July 2012 and everyone at the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly. It is always very tough to be away from home and family, but the employees at the Oakwood Manila helped to make it bearable.  Thanks"
689,August 2012,Birthday Staycation at Oakwood,NA,50,Had fun celebrating my birthday last August at this hotel. Everything I need are all here. Proximity to malls are not a problem.  Looking forward to bringing my entire family to experience the coziness and the homey feeling of staying here.
690,October 2012,Great stay as always!,NA,50,Modern clean rooms.  Service is great and the location is convenient with grocery shopping and restaurants at your feet!  My only gripe is that i like to cook and the 1 bedroom units only have 2 burner stoves where it is hard to get a pan and medium size pot on at the same time.
691,September 2012,Sept visit,NA,40,Always a terrific stay at Oakwood.  Have noitced some deterioration on terms of the area rugs and sofas in the rooms.  Suggestion in the studio rooms that a small table with a  chair and then a soft recliner or wing chair would seem more useful than that large sofa.  Was there a change in the bedding recently?  Beds seem somewhat harder.  Sleepin is challenging due to construction I'm sure.
692,December 2011,thumbs up!,NA,50,"Stayed here Christmas eve of 2011. My family enjoyed everything - room's are very spacious, everything is very organized with complete utensils, I super loved the bathroom with sauna. I love everything in this hotel.  I recommend Oakwood because what you get for your money is  excellent quality."
693,October 2012,Very good but no wifi available,NA,40,"Been there for two nights - Quality of room and breakfast simply superb - Astonished by the fact that wifi is not available !! This is unacceptable for a hotel of this kind - Apparently, the number of routers is limited - This issue needs to be corrected immediately - the size of the swimming pool is quite large"
694,October 2012,One of the most luxurious hotel I've been to.,NA,50,"I was looking for a hotel where me and my boyfriend could spend quality time together. My officemate who was staying in oakwood for 3 months now told me how gorgeous this hotel is. I instantly booked for a studio room for 3D/2N. But when I checked the reviews here and to my surprise everyone is complaining about the nearby construction site. But when we were there there was no noise, the receptinoist did an amazing job placing us in a quiet room. The interiors were fancy, you can cook there because of the complete kitchen utensils, I did not have the chance to have a tour to check out the other ammenities but I think its gourgeous too. But will stay here again and will check out the pool and gym. I only had one request, to have a smoking room and oakwood did not fail to satisfy"
695,September 2012,"An ideal place for seminars/conferences, dine and have fun!",NA,50,"A perfect hotel for trainings, seminars and conferences. Food is great coupled with very professional staffs. It is very safe and very proximate to shopping malls...Though I only attended a seminar for ten days, i guess the rooms and accomodation are comfortable and clean. It's more fun and safe to stay!"
696,October 2012,A promise,NA,50,"Stayed overnight for a business meeting.  Regretted not having stayed longer.  Rooms most adorable.  Sleek carpeting, silky curtains, marble floors, large mirrors, and true to their name, furniture made of oakwood.  Three flat screen TVs, DVD player, sofa, dining table, kitchen, a refrigerator that can stock a week's worth, microwave and standard oven, two airconditioners, his and hers washing sink, excellent shower and tub have all been previously mentioned by other reviewers.  But your own sauna?  Awesome!  Then the fitness center, the swimming pool and spa, even a kid's playroom.  Three large malls all within walking distance.  More than 50 restaurants in the vicinity to choose from.  Our group consciously wanted the meeting to be abbreviated so all of us could enjoy the"
697,September 2012,One of the best hotel experiences ever,NA,50,"I was in Manila on business for two weeks and stayed in an executive apartment. The apartment was massive. Full kitchen, living room with giant lcd tv, very large bedroom with an extremely comfortable bed also with ldc tv, large bathroom with shower and tub, even a tv. The housekeeping staff kept the room in immaculate condition and were extremely friendly. The Oakwood restaurant was a great experience as well. Staff were extremely friendly and courteous, always greeted me by name. The food was delicious. The workout facility was top notch. 4 treadmills, eliptical, two stationary bikes, an arobics room, and a weight area that was incredible. The entire staff provided outstanding service: . Twice had a massage through the spa, well worth it. I felt pampered the entire time there."
698,September 2012,Excellent Accomodation,NA,40,"I moved to Oakwood after having tried another facility in the Ortigas area in previous trips. There is a marked difference and the standard is consistent with Oakwood properties in other countries. The lobby was bright and the reception staff was helpful, with special mention for Jas.   I understand that the property is about 3 years old now but it is very well-maintained and the rooms are in excellent condition. Each room comes with a steam bath facility, which you can enjoy in your shower. This is the first time I have seen such a thing and it's great!   The location is excellent and if you are on a work trip, you should be able to find most of what you need. Podium Mall is directly across the road and there is also a Starbucks and Citbank just 5 mins' from the hotel."
699,September 2012,"Exceeded our expectations, again.",NA,50,"My husband loves this hotel, so for his 32nd birthday, we decided to stay here again for 3D/2N. I chose the 1BR due to the special occasion. There were 2 very minor glitches that were easily addressed: one was that we were put on a smoking room, but since the receptionist Benedict came to check us in, he noticed I was pregnant and decided to ask me if I specifically asked for a smoking room so when I said no, he immediately looked for a  different room and even placed us on a 1BR deluxe (corner) room. Also, when he mentioned that only one buffet breakfast was on my info, he immediately made some confirmations and called us to inform that this is now fixed. Now that's a proactive employee, so I never made a fuss about it since it was resolved asap. So our birthday celebration was"
700,September 2012,the Curse of Comfort,NA,50,"I have only written one review on TripAdvisor and that was back in April 2010. After staying at the Oakwood Premier here for 3 nights, I knew it was time to write a second. Despite it being my first time in the Philippines and having no knowledge of this place prior to arriving, and added to the fact that my clients booked the accommodation for me, I must say this was a fantastic place to stay in. The property is situated in Ortigas Avenue which is roughly about 30-40minutes from Makati taking into account the horrible traffic conditions in Manila and about 15-20mins from Quezon City where I worked. Despite not being in the heart of town, Oakwood Premier had everything other accommodations didn't. From the moment I walked in till the moment I checked out, the staff we extremely"
701,August 2012,Spacious Getaway,NA,40,"Right across the Asian Development Bank headquarters in Ortigas, the Oakwood Premier is a good choice if staying in the Ortigas area.  Rooms - very spacious. Had the 1-bedroom suite. Came with an open kitchen, with oven, microwave, stove, dishwasher and refrigerator. Complete also with plates, utensils, cooking needs, etc. The living / dining area is spacious, had a sofa that can sit 3-4 people, a round dining table that can sit 4, and a work table. comes with an LCD TV as well as speakers.  The bedroom is huge as well. Big bed and work table, with a bathroom that had a tub, and separate shower and toilet areas.  Dining - didnt dine at the hotel, as The Podium mall is just a short walk away. Had drinks at the Oakroom Bar, nice place at night, airconditioned bar where you can"
702,August 2012,World class hotel with very spacious rooms!!!,NA,50,"Our stay is one of the best stays we had in all hotels! I've been to luxurious hotels all over Asia and this is definitely one of the top! Spacious rooms and I mean really spacious! We used our 2 bedroom suite for my bridal preparation and all my suppliers and families fit very comfortably! The room is so charming, the photographer takes a picture of us and wedding materials in any and all corners of the hotel! The hotel is so luxurious, all TV are huge and there's even a flat screen in the bathroom! lovely lovely place to stay at when you're in ortigas, manila! My wedding is soo beautiful and one is because we chose Oakwood Premier Joy Nostalg Manila!"
703,July 2012,"Great hotel for balikbayans, residents and business travellers too!",NA,50,"I've stayed here at the Oakwood over a dozen times, usually with family and often with several colleagues booked at the same time. Service is excellent from check-in to check-out. The gym is one of the favorites amongst many other hotels Ive been to in Asia, and nothing beats the underwater music in the pool. Food is a bit pricey, including the breakfast buffet but then there are several affordable dining places nearby. If you have meetings and business in the Ortigas, and Mandaluyong area the location is perfect. The rooms are spacious and offers the ambiance of the home, and it surprises me everytime I check in and notice that the rooms are well-maintained. Agree with the suggestion of a wifi-access for biz travellers and improvement of lighting in the work tables. There is"
704,July 2012,A good serviced residence if doing business in Ortigas area,NA,30,"Oakwood Premier Joy Nostalg is a mixed used complex of office building and serviced residences strategically located in the business district of Ortigas Centre and within walking distance to a number of big shopping malls and good variety of restaurants.   Hotel car service by Avis to and from the airport, allow minimum one hour. Traffic are heavy within the area during rush hours and Friday evenings. Public taxis are easily accessible.   Room rates, reasonable. Hotel busier at weekends with apparent functions and groups.   Rooms Lovely, spacious serviced rooms. With fully equipped kitchenette and a small utility room with washer and dryer. Rooms overlooking the back road with major construction underway across the road will likely to continue until for at least another year."
705,July 2012,Canadian cooperation consultant in Manila,NA,30,"The hotel offers a mix of luxuries and shortcomings, more specifically: - The light in the apartment is very poor, starting with the lamp in the nightable (not enough to read) - Having wireless connection in the room is a must (particularly if you ask for an apartment is because you want to work with others and we need to access Internet) - The TV in the washroom results in a very small area for the guest's toiletteries, etc. - The iron and iron table were not in the room (had to specifically for them) - The duvets are too warm and I had to have the air conditioner against my will (or for period, sleep with no cover - there is no flat sheet -with the air conditioner off) - Construction work over night in the surrounding area do not help fight the jetlag.  On the positive side: -"
706,May 2012,Wonderful,NA,50,"we had a wonderful stay, we felt secured all the the way from check-in until check out except location is a little bit hard to find. May i further recommend to improve bathroom flooring which is slippery and add bidet in the toilet.  Generally we had wonderful stay"
707,April 2012,Great stay,NA,50,"Very nice and comfortable room, complete with all amenities and state of the art. Makes one feel at home, cozy and worry free. take a dip at the pool and relax some more. Will definitely book at this property. "
708,April 2012,8th stay @ Oakwood,NA,40,"Always a refreshing stay at the Oakwood in Manila. Staff are friendly and helpful going the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. Business travel can be quite stressful, but the team at the Oakwood makes you really feel at home. I would and have recommended the hotel to friends and business associates that stay in the Metro Manila area and will continue to do so. Thanks to Love and Apple for coordinating my stays in the past, both ladies are wonderful to deal with and make arrangements quickly and efficiently."
709,July 2012,Good stay,NA,40,"WHAT I LIKED: Clean, well decorated. Good breakfast. Very convenient location, especially for ADB. Well mannered and helpful staff.  WHAT COULD BE BETTER: Plug points not convenient for using the iron. No shower cap in the bathroom."
710,April 2012,Everything was special,NA,50,"When I got married this year, there was only one hotel of choice for me (and it's not even a hotel). First, I wanted it to be near the church where I will be wed, and I wanted it to be at the heart of a commercial and business district. So, Oakwood was perfect. The rooms were A-list and the service was superb. I have been in and out of hotels for the past years and complaining has always been a part of my experience. At Oakwood, I had the best of everything for a sweet price. Since Oakwood was one of my wedding choices, it will always be special to me and my wife."
711,April 2012,Manila 2012,NA,40,I thought the hotel was very nice. A little noisy. Construction from within the hotel as well as outside. Also chairs moving on the marble floors made a lot of noise from rooms above. Staff was excellent and service was always prompt and friendly.
712,April 2012,Best condominium-style hotel in Manila,NA,50,"Stayed at an amazingly HUGE luxury studio (~700 sq ft) with my sister. Loved the spectacular view of the city with the floor-to-ceiling gigantic windows. The bathroom was also fabulous with it's flat-screen TV, rain-style shower, and the bathroom can turn into a sauna. There is also an in-unit washer and dryer, which is a plus when traveling! Staff were very welcoming and accommodating. Lots to do around the area too. I would definitely stay there again next time I go back to the Philippines."
713,June 2012,Business stay,NA,40,Overall stay was pleasant. I found out that the cut fruits served at buffet line do not have onion taste unlike previously and my comments on that issue has been addressed.
714,June 2012,Never disappointed!,NA,50,"I have stayed at this hotel initially for business trips which were booked through my work, but have enjoyed the stays every time that i decided to stay there also during my personal trips. The location of this hotel is fantastic - so close to the main malls (Robinsons and MegaMall), as well as the cheap markets (St Francis). Also within easy access to many places where you can eat good food, quick snacks, take away, coffees, etc...being surrounded by businesses means there are many convenience stores etc. The staff at Oakwood are very professional, but also relaxed so you do not feel like you are dealing with anyone pretentious at all. They will remember your name (which ever you prefer - first or surname), and ensure you are very well looked after. If you are in habit of"
715,June 2012,Very Comfortable Stay With All The Right Amenities,NA,50,"Oakwood provides a comfortable home away, with a touch of luxury and friendly service. The provision of a washer dryer is a fantastic improvement to one's stay."
716,June 2012,No better value in Manila!,NA,50,"HAve stayed here at least 7 times in last 2 years - fantastic value, fantastic staff ! Rooms are home away from home and do not feel like a hotel, sports facilities also excellent. I recommend this place to all my friends  "
717,May 2012,Loosing steam,NA,30,"This have been the fourth time I have been to this hotel/ service apartment, it is very convenient for my business in Manila, and within the are among the most recommendable for quality/price.  However this place is loosing steam. They started fairly well, providing very well appointed apartments with amenities ""of this century"" (unlike others in the area). The service was good to very good and the studio rooms, although not very well design to my taste, are functional providing a decent room with all that you need for  short or medium time away from home.   The biggest attraction to this service apartment and for which I normally like to pay extra in any hotel was the breakfast buffet. You cannot start a good day without a good breakfast and in a service apartment normally this"
718,May 2012,Really lovely apartments,NA,40,"I stayed here for a week in May 2012 and have to say I really liked it. I stayed in a one bed which was huge and had everything that I wanted.   I used the room service and restaurant several times and really enjoyed all of the food I had.   The gym was well equipped although small, but every time I went in there I was the only one, so it wasn't a problem.   I was a bit gutted that there is no outdoor pool to relax by. I didn't use the indoor pool, but looked very nice.   Can't wait to come back!"
719,December 2011,Ortigas serviced apartment,NA,40,"We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment.  It was huge, with the necessary amenities.  The kitchen had cooking paraphernalia and utensils, there were 3 TVs in the living room area, the bedroom and the bathroom fronting the tub.  The furnitures and cabinets were tastefully done.  Ours had the view of the different buildings beside the hotel but yonder is the greens of the Wack Wack golf club.  The breakfast that goes with the room had fresh fruits and the usual fare for breakfast but not too plentiful.  The indoor swimming pool was not that big but kids seem to love it.  The hotel is walking distance to Podium but not to Megamall although it is very near, because of the heat, we opted to take a cab."
720,April 2012,Very comfortable and highly recommended,NA,50,"I stayed at the Oakwood for 2 weeks in April 2012 and was very impressed with all aspects of the hotel. The staff from arrival to departure we always very helpful, polite and met all expectations. When I first arrived they helped to bring the luggae up to my room which was on the 17th floor and I stayed in a 3 room suite which had everything I needed. A full kitchen, dining table, comfortable sofa, internet, 3 TV's ( didnt need 3 Tv's but useful to have ), double bed, 2 bottles of complimentary water every day ( all hotels should offer this but they dont - this I rate very highly as important for any stay ) The bed was comfortable, bathroom spacious and well equiped, room service was good and always within 25 - 30 mins, room was always spotless each night after arriving from"
721,April 2012,Service level on the way down,NA,30,"This is my 6th stay at this apartment in 1.5 years, and while all facilities in and out of the room remain of high quality, I noticed that the service level has gone backwards of late, unfortunately. I stayed in Room 1010 for 2 nights checking in on 23 April. On my final night there, I requested for a late check-up at 2pm the next day which they kindly granted. My meeting was to end at 11 am and I had planned to return to the apartment to refesh myself and catch up on emails before my 2pm transfer to the airport. I also requested for a wake-up call at 7:15 am. The next morning, I noticed that the wake up call didn't come at all. Not a problem I thought, it must have been a rare miss on their part. In any case, I woke up on my own at 7 am. After breakfast, on my way out, I"
722,August 2011,Great place to stay,NA,50,"I have stayed at this hotel many times while in Manila for business and have never had a bad experience. Right from the very beginning the staff are very helpful and are always wanting to make my stay the best it can be. Staying up to 3 weeks at for each visit the staff quickly recognized me every day and always greeted me by name everywhere I went and always asking how my stay was so far. The rooms are very spacious and great to unwind in after a long flight or day at work.   Upon arrival the rooms are always spotless and cleaned very thoroughly every day. The bathrooms are great with amazing with huge mirrors, shower/sauna and bath.  The hotel food is great although room service can be a little slow (although I did expect it to be at the 6-7pm time).   The only other issue I"
723,April 2012,Best hotel I've staid at..,NA,50,"Why? .. Imagine yourself coming from a long International flight, heading to your hotel.. Arriving, first getting greeted by a smile, being asked how the trip was, if there is anything which could be done to enjoy your stay.. and you haven't even entered the room ..   Coming to that part.. imagine further when the bellboy carries in the bags, and you have an entire 150 sqm, 3 room apartment, with antique furniture, overlooking the city, with steam shower, jacuzzi, and 3 flat screen tv's !! .. What is there to criticize ? .. simply nothing.. every corner of the apartment was cared for, fresh fruits on the table, leather sofa(s?), dinner table, washing machine, a double king size bed .. this was just too much too handle.. only downer was you really could not concentrate at work,"
724,April 2012,Stress-free week at Oakwood Premier Joy~Nostalg Center Manila,NA,50,"My husband and I stayed at this property for a week. Check in was a bliss, we were never dissappointed with our room, all the facilities are working perfectly. Even the A/C works to our satisfaction. Housekeeping staff was very polite and accomodating. Never had a request that we have to wait for a long period of time before they deliver. We stayed at the 1 BR suite and we both agreed that it was spacious, the kitchen had all the tools that you could think of. There's a washing machine, though, we only used it once. Overall, I was very satisfied. Will definitely come back again."
725,June 2011,Home away from home,NA,50,"This hotel is so far the best I've ever been. We stayed at the one bedroom suite (approx. 85sqm) and we find it very spacious. They got best kitchen complete with tools and it has a nice washing machine too. They got a very nice bathroom, nice big with television. Rooms are sound proof. Staff are very polite too."
726,March 2012,Almost perfect,NA,40,"Overall, my family and I enjoyed our stay at one of the 3-bedroom Executive Suites.  The rooms were beautiful, and very comfortable.  The beds in particular, were exceptionally comfortable. So, even when I only had 4 or 5 hours sleep, I felt well rested. The kitchen was spacious although there could have been a wider variety of cooking utensils- pots and pans, specifically.  My stepmom who loves to cook, often had to make do with the large pots and pans when cooking smaller meals because she eventually became embarrassed to keep asking guest services for additional kitchen tools.  The bathrooms were nice, although I was surprised that no bidets were installed - which I thought would have been a standard in a serviced apartment of this caliber.  The steam shower in the bathroom"
727,February 2012,Good Hotel. Mediocre Service,NA,30,"I have already completed more than 60days of stay in the Oakwood Premier Service Apts, Manila as part of my international assignment and surprised to see poor housekeeping & breakfast services. Though there are a lot of pure vegetarian Indians staying there and we all requesting for atleast one good vegetarian dish (not even an Indian dish), they are reluctant to honor that yet. Moreover today I've received a notification from the Oakwood management that there would not be any Housekeeping support on the April 4th, 5th &6th, 2012 owing to the holy week!! Where in the world have anyone heard of a service industry not working on a 365day cycle in a year due to some celebration!!! I've asked them who would clean the trash can in the kitchen & toilet and they do not have an answer!!"
728,January 2012,Oakwood Premier Joy~Nostalg Center Manila,NA,50,"Stayed at this property from 01/19/2012-02/19/2012 for business. The apartment was very comfortable with all amenities needed readily available. The staff at the Oakwood are always very helpful, accomodating and professional, they go out of their way to remember their guests names adding that personal touch to your stay."
729,February 2012,I WANT TO GO BACK,NA,50,"its really worth it.  Rooms are so big.  Suite room.  Its a penthouse !!!  :-)  Its really clean.  You have a kingsized bed, 2 LCD tvs, microwave, dining table, sofa, office table, TV at tub, etc.  Its worth it.  I will really go back."
730,September 2011,Oakwood Stay,NA,50,"Upon my arrival to Oakwood I was already impressed by the service the staff provided. Everyone was very accomodating, friendly & respectful to their client. I would consider the ambiience & amenities better than a five star hotel. I felt so at home in this place. I felt SAFE. This was my best visit to Manila ever :-)"
731,January 2012,Excellent,NA,50,"Excellent hotel with wonderful rooms at a good price. Would recommend without hesitation. Location is ok, just depends on where in Manila you need to be, thus the low rating on that part is more about distributed Manila rather than the Hotel itself."
732,August 2011,Great stay,NA,50,Staff were so friendly and made me feel like I was at a home away from home during my 7 week stay. would definitely recommend
733,October 2011,Work Trip,NA,40,"The staff were excellent and remembered my name right from day 1. My room however was not cleaned as well as it could have been , in particular the bathroom. Overall, a beautiful hotel with top class facilities and I would have no hesitation in staying there again whether for business or personal."
734,September 2011,Review,NA,40,"All was good except construction outside during the day when we were trying to sleep.  Service for breakfast was good by the waiters - loved how they knew us by name.  Opportunities with car service can be improved - coordination when groups are going to same location - many times solo travellers don't know what shuttles are available, etc.  That should be coordinated not only by the company but hotel/car rental."
735,March 2012,Felt like home,NA,50,Stayed at Oakwood for over 8 months and can't compare the great experience. Rooms are very spacious and modern. Well maintained facilities and has everything contained within the premises. The great hospitality extended every day by the staff is above the very high local standards. The location is very central to the business district and night life.
736,February 2012,Top Notch Stay,NA,50,"I could not have asked for more during my staff at Oakwood Premier Joy-Nostalg Center in Manila.  It was wonderful to be respectfully greeted by name by each staff member, have my needs attended to as soon as they were verbalized, if not before and know that I would return to a clean, spacious room each day after work.  The work out facilities were very clean and accessible and overlooked the beautiful pool, which was a treat!  I could easily walk to a variety of shopping areas or have a safe taxi called for me when I needed.  I truly felt pampered during my stay!"
737,March 2012,Misleading indeed.,NA,30,"To be fair, there are good and negative points to this hotel. Good points are that the rooms are new, big, good location if your work is near by, nicely organized, flat screen TV in bathroom, pool with music playing inside of it. But the negative points is that the service is horrible. Dining room was understaffed to the extent that it took 5 requests for a waiter to bring a glass of extra ice for me, dining buffet food quality and variety was mediocre and over marketed, housekeeping does a quick and very mediocre of (i agree with previous review), people at reception were slow to respond and at times never responded at all to queries. the hotel is indeed new and well equipped, but for the price of the room and the headache of running after the understaffed hotel staff members"
738,February 2012,"Nice hotel, but luxury is a bit misleading",NA,30,"The hotel is fine and it is true that it is very new, which is nice, but I think to call it a luxury hotel or a 5-star hotel is pretty misleading.  It's certainly not on par with Shangri-La or Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons types of hotels.  Also, I had issues with the cleanliness of the room, as I stayed for a week and the floor was never vacuumed or mopped - there were huge dustbunnies under my bed.  The concierge downstairs and the airport cars to/from the hotel were good quality, but the food/room service is really not that good, the food is just average.  I ended up walking to the nearby mall for dinner after a couple nights of so-so room service.  One of the nights I had a fish that tasted really old.  The location is very convenient if you have an office nearby and/or like"
739,March 2012,Nice but Inconsistent,NA,30,"This hotel is study in contrasts. On the surface it seems nice but look a little deeper and you'll see flaws that impact the experience. Upon entering my room three light bulbs were burnt out and needed replacing. I was there for three days before a washcloth was added to the linens in my bathroom. The shower sauna is great - except that it leaks under the sink when on and floods the bathroom floor. The kitchen was stocked with pots and pans and dishes - but the dinner plates were larger than the cupboards and the doors could not be shut properly. Breakfast buffet inconsistant - one day a multitude of dishes, the next only half the amount of the previous day. The staff is very friendly but I had to ask four times for an electronic copy of my bill to be sent to me. For the price"
740,November 2011,Nice for business,NA,40,"I was put up at the Oakwood on a business trip.  The one bedroom apartment was nicely appointed.  The staff was very helpful and the duty nurse took care of one in our party that became sick.  Each night we went to the lounge to have a drink and sometimes dinner.  Dinners at the lounge were generally excellent.  Some of the breakfast was ""American"", the rest is what we would call dinner, but all was pretty tasty.  I haven't been to other places in Manila, but I felt safe here and would definately come back.  We did happen to be there during a holiday time (halloween and Nov 1).  The hotel shut down all housekeeping operations unless you specifically requested them."
741,February 2012,Comfortable Stay at the Oakwood,NA,40,"- The Single Room is good and clean. - Breakfast selection can be improved but the basics (sausages, eggs, pancakes, cereals, etc) are provided and taste good. - Meeting room is spacious for 15 participants - just 1 comment on lunch being served at the meeting room. Lunch is preferred to be at the restaurant/cafe as this can generate more interaction with the participants. Lunch served in the meeting room is not a bad idea but the ambience of formality still remains and interactions may be lesser. - Service is very prompt and with good courtesies. - The location of the hotel is good and we don’t feel danger around the vicinity. - Also, it is quite near to the airport even with the traffic jam - around 30 to 40 mins So all in all, I’m pleased with it. "
742,December 2011,Top of the Tops,NA,50,"Spent an overnight stay here with my wife back in December and we were quite impressed. The room was sooo spacious and had so many great amenities such as the microwave oven and even a dishwasher that we considered extended our stay for a little longer.  Location is prime in the heart of the Ortigas center and walking distance to the nearby malls. Service (both front desk and room service) was top notch, and the food was very affordable.   Nice touch to have a living area with its own flat screen TV, and another for the main bedroom and a smaller one for the bathroom. It's like you could choose to sleep anywhere and you'd still be comfortable. Excellent service and top notch hotel."
743,October 2011,Bad Experience.,NA,40,Overall it was good! except for the ladies at the front desk...they never smile and I FIND THEM VERY RUDE....my check-in and out was a very bad experience. I will never recommend your hotel to my friends and relatives.
744,October 2011,Excellent Experience!,NA,50,"This hotel was highly recommended by a colleague.  Excellent experience!  The staff was very attentive and knowledgable, the room, exercise facilities, and restaurant were very clean, comfortable and inviting, even with my goofy hours.  I will certainly stay there when I return to Manila!"
745,August 2011,Not so good experience :(,NA,20,"Hi, I stayed here for my pre-wedding. However, I was booked in a room beside an ongoing construction site (although they knew that it was for a wedding!). It wouldn't really look good for our pictorial and the noise level was high.  We requested for a room change.  However, we were turned down due to high volume of guests. We escalated the issue to the manager.  But still we were refused to be transferred (even when we offered to upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite).  The 2 bedroom suites are available but they insisted that it was for long staying guests. Eventually I was able to pull some strings and was able to move to the bigger room - a lot of time wasted :(  Overall, the rooms are really good but it sure made my pre-wedding day very stressful considering we still had a lot of"
746,October 2011,Business Stay in Otaigas Center,NA,40,"Overall I really enjoyed my stay. The room was nice with good facilities and the staff were very friendly. However, my stay was let down by a few things. The main issue was that I went to the front desk the night before my departure to organised transport to the airport and was assured that it would be booked but when I arrived at the reception the next morning they had no record of a booking to take me to the airport. To the credit of the staff they did organise transport very quickly and I made it on time. Another minor issue was that the fridge in the room was noisy and so I turned it off to get a better night’s sleep. Other issues were noisy construction going on next door to the hotel and getting a breakfast omelette containing ham when I ordered one without (I am"
747,August 2011,Amazing Property and Staff - Will be back!,NA,50,"I stayed for 3 weeks at this property last year and can't wait to visit again.  The building is in a great area, the property is sparkling clean and the rooms are very lavish and have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Flat screen tv's, an amazing bathroom and wonderful service any time of the day or night!  The car service was first rate and the drivers were knowledgeable and fast.  The bar/restaurant/room service was always quick and attentive.  The local area around the hotel has plenty of shopping, bars and restaurants for whatever you need.  I will absolutely stay at Oakwood when I return to Manila.  The value for money was outstanding and the staff makes it an experience you won't forget.  Go there and see for yourself!"
748,October 2011,A truly positive experience,NA,50,"Thank you for the amazing experience I had while staying at the Oakwood.  The rooms are kept amazingly clean, the service is spectacular and the people are the nicest you will ever meet.  The only reason for the low rating on sleep quality is because of all the construction outside my room.  I was a day sleeper and this was a loud inconvenience, but on my weekends I slept like a baby in my extra comfy king sized bed!  It was all I could do to stop myself from trying to hide those fantastic pillows in my luggage! Loved my visit and hope to be back soon!"
749,December 2011,Amazing.,NA,50,"My wife and daughter stayed at Oakwood Premier last December 29 and 30. The staff, from the front desk to the bell hops and housekeeping staff performed efficiently and ready with a smile and greeting. Even if it was a very busy day, the staff managed to be ready with a genuine smile and greeting. It made us feel right at home. The room was excellent, no complaints whatsoever. The buffet breakfast was very good and had a lot of choices. One thing I liked was the variety. I am already planning our next vacation there and we are planning to stay longer. Special thanks Jack Ng and his lovely wife Rachel for the thoughtful birthday cake. More power to you!"
750,December 2011,The Scrooge In Oakwood At Christmas,NA,30,"I had high expectations for this property, seeing the many positive reviews and the pictures of the place here and in other sites.  Let me break it easy: I was not pleased.  Let's start with the positive: The place, when considered from a physical sense, was great. I am in agreement with some reviews here that state that it has better amenities and a more exquisite feel than other 5 star hotels (as Oakwood says it is a serviced apartment and not a hotel in the strictest sense).  The breakfast was unusual (it had a beef and liver skewer and risotto in its lineup for the breakfast buffet) but I'm treating that as thinking out of the box and not being stuck with the usual omelettes and bacon - which they also had.  The negatives:  No parking space available. (Despite being a"
751,June 2011,Birthday celebration!,NA,50,"i Certainly enjoyed every minute of our very short stay at Oakwood. Staff were very nice and accommodating and the our room was VERY LAVISH!  I love facilities and the amenities. My friends and i enjoyed out stay. I kept on telling them that its the BEST. Better than the rest of the ""mainstream"" hotels such as Shangrila or Manilla Pen."
752,August 2011,Great for long-stay,NA,50,"I stayed at the Oakwood for approximately 6 weeks and would stay there again.  The staff were very friendly - always greeting me by name and going out of their way to be helpful.  The room was cleaned well and the amenities were plentiful.  I found my room to be quiet and comfortable. I did not have breakfast daily in the restaurant but did go on weekends and found it to be pretty good.  A selection of both western and asian with pastries, fresh fruit, cereals and an egg/omelette bar."
753,November 2011,The BEST hotel i have ever stayed in!,NA,50,"I have stayed in many hotels in Manila, ranging from Shangri la, The Peninsula, Inter Continental, Somerset Millenium and Somerset Olympia. But in my personal opinion, none of the other 5 star hotels in Manila could match Oakwood in terms of service and quality of room. The bed is just so comfortable, the room is big and quiet, the bathroom is just luxurious! Bath salt are even provided!  I read in a couple of reviews that the breakfast weren't impressive, I would like to correct that because I personally love the breakfast I had in the Oakroom. One of my favourite dish was the Pork Merlot. It think was really good. This should be a mainstay dish!  I also love the mini kitchen in the hotel, you have all the kitchen equipment and cutlery needed to dish up a storm!   And oh, don't"
754,December 2011,Unfortunate circumstances,NA,30,"My room wasn't ready for me when I arrived after an almost 22 hour journey to get here, eventhough the hotel had my flight info and even picked my up from the hotel. I was then put in a non smoking room even though I explicitly booked a smoking room. It then took them 3 days to move me into a smoking room as well as provide me with a wireless router ( also requested when room was booked).   I had a leak in the second bedroom washroom from the ceiling which turned out to be a clogged drain pipe, but it was fixed very quickly. My biggest complaint of all would have to be the continuous jack hammer noises coming from the construction of a condo building next door, it goes on and on all day, which doesn't help when i am trying tomsleepmin the day as I am here for work and work over"
755,November 2011,Nice hotel,NA,40,"Decided to have a night away from home with my wife, and decided to check out Oakwood since it is relatively new and I have heard good things about it from colleagues. I was very happy with the choice. The room was well appointed and comfortable, check-in was smooth and the personnel were all very friendly.   I was a bit taken aback at first when security wanted to inspect my bags on the way into the hotel, but this was because we entered through the commercial side elevator by accident. When I complained that this was pretty extreme for a hotel, they called a security dog over to check instead of a visual exam. Were it not for this small snafu, I would have given the hotel a 5 star rating.  Overall, it was a great hotel, a good value, and a convenient location for traveling in"
756,November 2011,Premium service - Excellent Hospitality,NA,50,Stayed over 6 months and did nto encounter any issues during my stay. The world famous Philipino hospitality is displayed at its finest in Oakwood. I would recommend this place for pleasure as well as business. Thier meeting rooms were are well appointed and equipped with all desired amenities. The dining room allowed you to host meetings in private.  The amenities were very weel maintained and the pool being indoors allowed me to make use of the facilities even during not so sunny afternoons.  Cannot think of a better experience haveing travelled for over 5 years. 
757,November 2011,Breakfast was underwhelming.,NA,30,"I'm a breakfast person. I was excited to have my fill at the breakfast buffet this morning. So what do we have here - left side is a 1.5 meter spread of fresh fruits : pineapple, melon, grapes (peeled but with seeds), yogurt in cups, bowls of preserved and dried fruits, few cheese slices (terribly thin), few cold cuts. On the right side is a similar table with simple breads and pastries, fruit jams, cereals and nuts in small jars (?) 3 types of juices in dispensers. In the center is a 2 meter diameter round table with food warmers containing, rice, congee, some fish, sausages, and well- let me just say it was forgettable. Oh they do have a hole in the wall with a guy ready to cook your omelette for you.  Coffee was brewed but not fresh and ergo not fragrant- disappointing for a"
758,October 2011,Ideal Stay for Business Travelers Who R Also Shopoholics,NA,40,"Within walking distance of 4 main shopping malls, and a 10 minute taxi ride to some terrific markets, the location of this lovely establishment makes it the ideal choice for travelers that like to shop hard, after working hard.  Staff are very friendly, and very efficient. The apartments are well appointed with a luxurious bed and bedding, and after 2 weeks, I felt I had a home away from home. The restaurant, and food are great, and the gym has excellent facilities.... My only one concern was some inconsiderate neighbors that partied well into the night, on 2 occasions. Luckily, a pair of ear-plugs I keep handy redeemed my sleep. Perhaps a set of standards reflecting the need to respect the comfort of other guests would be useful if included in their service portfolio."
759,October 2011,"Excellent accommodation, unintrusive service",NA,50,"I stayed at the Oakwood for a week while in Metro Manila on a business trip.  The Oakwood was the perfect home for the week.  The building is a high-rise in the Ortigas area of Pasig city (more specifically, the barangay of San Antonio).    I experienced many of the positives previous reviewers have noticed.  Number one is the high quality accommodation.  My 10th floor room was impeccably clean and appointed.  It had a quite spacious kitchen (about the same size of many studio condos) with large fridge, microwave, stove, and spacious storage areas; a little lounge area with couch and hardwood table; a large and very comfortable double bed; a bright and roomy bathroom, a small office area with broadband internet access; and a washer/dryer.  In other words, pretty much everything"
760,October 2011,"First rate hospitality, room and facilities",NA,50,"I was in Manila for a 'lady of leisure' weekend and the hospitality of the staff indeed helped. For those who have not been to Manila, there is always a security station at the entrance of prominent public places (eg malls, some hotels) to check your bags. The hotel staff that checked my bag were always polite and almost apologetic for the 'inconvenience', and this first impression at the entrance carried through with all the other staff inside.  The room is tastefully decorated. I loved the quilted headboard of the bed and the reading chair with ottoman in the bedroom. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The duvet enveloped me snugly as a duvet should (I actually removed the linen to look for the brand of duvet and pillow - Snoozy, figures). The kitchen"
761,December 2010,One of the BEST,NA,50,I really recommend this HOTEL! Its my 2nd stay in this hotel! everything is Materiales Fuertes! I love it! I love the smell of the lobby and i believe its their signature scent. I love the swimming pool and the gym! the rooms are very luxurious and very clean! Highly recommended!
762,August 2011,Manila City Vacation,NA,50,"Like many city dwellers we like to get away for weekends now again. The problem is the time and trouble  it takes to get to the destination - Friday traffic jams, crowded airports, rough ferry crossings. Anyway, sometimes we just move into a city hotel for a night or two and that's why we went to the Oakwood Premier in Ortigas (opp. ADB). From the outside it looks just like an office building but inside are some of the biggest hotel rooms in Manila and they have kitchens. It's kind of a high rise resort with big rooms, nice views and a big INDOOR swimming pool and that's a rarity in Manila. We loved it. Ginormous American beds, flat screen TV's everywhere (even in the bathroom) and a 5-star buffet breakfast. And my wife has just reminded me, there's an excellent spa. Most Manila"
763,September 2011,excellent choice,NA,40,"(Demographics of reviewer:  55-year-old male; health professional; monthly intercontinental traveler for business/pleasure).  This was our 3rd sojourn at an Oakwood serviced apartment.  Our first visit was to the old Oakwood located in the business district of Makati City when the franchise was still held by the Ayala family.  That apartment is now part of the Ascott chain.  The new Oakwood is now located in the commercial/business district of Pasig City, and is situated right behind the sprawling compound of the Asian Development Bank.  We stayed at the Oakwood in Feb 2010, then again last month, Sept 2011.  During our first stay, my wife, my 3 sons, and I stayed in a luxurious, 3-bdrm unit.  For our second stay, my wife and I rented a studio.  I will discuss the serviced"
764,September 2011,Fabulous return to the Oakwood,NA,50,"Having previously stayed at the Oakwood before, I was already quite impressed with the very high quality of the rooms, the hotel services, the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff as well as the warm and always welcoming atmosphere at this extremely nice hotel and/or serviced apartment (as you will). On my recent stay, my former experience was squarely topped - being upgraded to a 3 bedroom apartment, I truly was able to experience the 'awesome' (there is no other word for it) level of luxury the Oakwood does provide. The decor, the spaciousness and the refinement of the vast serviced apartment suite offered to me simply blew me away. This place is ideal for a long term stay in Manila, and the quality of the furnishings, the cleanliness of the accommodation as well as the"
765,August 2011,Service Supreme,NA,50,I have been staying at the Oakwood in Pasig (Manila) for about 6 weeks now.  I have never experienced service like I have at the Oakwood.  The staff are exceptional.  The facilities are A+.  The location is good.  It would be better if this apartment / hotel was located in Makati as there is more life in that part of Manila.  This Pasig location seem a bit like it is in the suburbs.  There are 5 pretty good malls within walking distance which is quite convenient.  The Oakwood has an arrangement with Avis so you can arrange for car service at any time of the day or night.  I highly recommend using the Oakwood for short of long stays.  You won't be disappointed.
766,February 2011,Perfect for family weekend bonding,NA,40,"We enjoy checking in at hotels in Manila from time to time. Oakwood is perfect for family bonding because youbcan just stay in the hotel all weekend, watching DVDs, have food delivered or cook/heat food because the rooms are equipped with kitchen and dining amenities. the indoor  pool is heated and uses salt water instead of chlorine. Breakfast buffet however is average. just in case you like to go to the mall, Podium is just  a few meters away. Tye staff is courteous and friendly too."
767,September 2011,A joy to return to Oakwood!,NA,50,Oakwood is my favorite hotel in Manila. The staff is so friendly and helpful The breakfast is abundant and delicious. The price is right.  It was a pleasure to return to Oakwood again.
768,June 2011,The best so far!,NA,50,"I had a sudden idea of having a relaxing weekend, so I asked my husband to stay here for 3 days. He was actually against it at first but after seeing our room, it became our benchmark for hotels to stay! One thing is because its new (opened in a year or two) so the facilities are in their tip top shape. We just stayed on the studio executive and of course, hearing that type will mean a small place, right? WRONG! The space was utilized in the best way we never felt cramped. We never left our room except for lunch or dinner. I just love, love, love this hotel. =)"
769,August 2011,Satisfaction,NA,40,"Thank you for a great trip.  I was on site with 40 colleagues, and we all had a great time, experience and no issues. The service at the Front Desk was great, the room attendants were awesome.  The dinning room is not as good of an experience.  The service for Lunch and Dinner is very slow, unorganized, and needs some help.  There does not seem to be a good flow.  The wait staff is does not seem to understand the simple flow,bring the drinks, any appitizers, then salads, then the meals for the whole table.  They just seem to bring out food as it is done.  Maybe this is a kitchen driving flow."
770,July 2011,The Best in Manila,NA,50,This hotel is more than a hotel. The staff is incredible and it made it hard for me to leave.  Restaurant is pretty good but too expensive compared to what you will find outside the hotel.  My room was WAY beyond my expectations.  I was stunned by the fact that EVERYONE in the hotel knew my name.  Fantastic experience. Don't hesitate.
771,August 2011,Luxurious business hotel,NA,40,"It's perfect for business travellers, esp for those staying a week or longer. We stayed in a 1br deluxe suite because the superior is not available. Diff i think is just the location, deluxe is a corner unit. Highlights - fully furnished unit, complete kitchen, dishwasher, and washing machine. It's got everything you'll need in a house/condo! My toddler loved swimming at their indoor pool n jacuzzi. Loved the bathtub complete w bath salts + shower room w steambath! Spacious cabinets perfect for long term stay. TV/home entertainment system in living room, master's br & bathroom! Breakfast was above average, it was relaxing to stay at the oakroom w great floor to ceiling views and coffee served included cappuccino, latte, americano, etc. Not just the usual brewed coffee. Aircon"
772,November 2010,Worth every penny,NA,50,"Location: Oakwood's location is pretty convenient. It is but a few steps away from two major malls, the Podium and Robinson's Galleria. Starbucks and 7-11 are also very near if you suddenly need a caffeine fix.  The hotel has two entrances as it also houses several offices. The entrance along ADB avenue is the hotel's where you can access the malls. The other side is the office entrance where security is a bit tighter. You can exit out of here to go to Ortigas Park where rows and rows of restaurants are available even late at night.  One thing you would immediately notice from the moment you step in the lobby is how nice the hotel smells.  Room:  We booked the Studio Room (the cheapest) and since it is a serviced apartment, it comes with complete apartment amenities. "
773,July 2010,nice!,NA,50,"I wasn't expecting anything when I first got here, thinking it was just a regular bedroom suite.I was just looking for a place for my friends & I to stay overnight. I got  the 1 bedroom suite. the living room & dining room's nice. so is the kitchen it's  fully equipped. the bedroom's okay too. what exceeded my expectation was the bathroom. it was spacious. loved the tub w/ lcd screen and the shower stall worked as a sauna i think. they have a nice indoor pool area too. the staff was very helpful too. over all it was a very pleasant experience."
774,June 2011,Great place in depressing location,NA,40,"This is a new place, well finished and with good amenities. Service is great. Surroundings are depressing with all the constructions sites and jack hammers. Highly recommended if one has business in the area."
775,June 2011,Excellent hotel with great facilities and impeccable service,NA,50,"Stayed for a second time in a studio apartment at Oakwood Premier for an extended business trip and found that the Oakwood is now my top choice of accomodation in Manila. Very cosy rooms with great facilities (LCD television even in the bathroom, full kitchen, nice working and ample storage space - plus a washing machine) and tasteful, modern furnishings. The beds are especially laudable: big, comfortable and very clean. The highlight of my stay were the staff: always smiling and greeting guests there really is an air of hospitality and friendliness that makes you feel instantly welcome and at home. The private dining service is great - offering a wide selection of dishes (Western and Asian) at very reasonable prices. We also used the Oakwood restaurant staging an Italian food"
776,November 2010,The SUITEST of Them All,NA,50,"I set my expectations too high in this place, and it didn't disappoint. It even exceeded my expectations. This is the first time I saw a hotel room as new, classy, and elegant as this one. The interiors has this sophisticated appearance. It smells very good too, and not a noise can be heard.  Bed: freshest and most comfortable bed and pillows Bathroom: the loveliest and most tempting bathroom ever.  It has its own LCD television facing the tub, a shower and steam bath.  I have lot of pictures for reference. These include photos of the room pool, jacuzzi, and breakfast Oakroom. http://www.chyngreyes.com/2010/11/suitest-of-them-all.html"
777,April 2011,"Modern, clean and tasteful",NA,50,"Stayed here for a week in April while on business in the area. The room I stayed in had luxurious modern furnishings, flat screen TVs and floor to ceiling windows. It also had a kitchen as well as washing machine which would be ideal for a longer-term stay. The bed was very comfortable with quality linen, the bathroom with massive shower was great and there was a desk for working (which unfortunately I had to do!)  Breakfasts had a decent selection but I didn’t try the restaurant out for dinner as the three nearby shopping malls had loads of eateries. Would highly recommend The Cafe Mediterranean in The Podium mall (5 min walk away) for tasty greek food.  My only disappointments were that I didn’t have wifi and had to sit at the desk to use the internet cable, and that there"
778,April 2011,A comfortable stay,NA,40,"Stayed at oakwood for easter. Reservation was expertly handled by John and Ms. remulla and efficiently implemented by Ms. kathleen .Stayed with family in a two bedroom suite. It's very spacious  and well equipped. The unit has a kitchen , stove, oven , refrigerator with a dishwasher . All you need to bring is food to cook and drinks. There is a big living room and a dining table for 6.   The beds are comfortable. Not quite sure if they have hypoallergenic pillows as i forgot to request. My son so loooves the TV in the bathroom as he can take a bath watching his favorite cartoon. What we like best is the heated indoor pool. It is good for both the kids and adults who can't tolerate cold water anymore. Just one precaution: my son likes staying in the jacuzzi portion for the"""
779,December 2010,FLAWLESS. EXCEPT FOR THE BFAST,NA,50,"Stunning rooms. Bathrooms with lcd tv by the tub and built in sauna in showers. Wall to ceiling glass allows you to see the room while you're bathing in the tub. Complete kitchen amenities that you don't need to bring anything to prepare dinner. You can roast turkey in their top of the line oven! Get the one bedroom instead of the studio bec difference in price is so worth it. It's huge! Bigger than the average hotel one bedrooms. We originally booked the studio but the only table you can use to dine is their coffee table. Breakfast was 3 star though. Other than that, it's topnotch from rooms to service. Oh it's also one of the very few pet friendly hotels in Manila. Central location in Ortigas. The indoor pool looked nice but wasnt able to try."
780,March 2011,Where everybody knows your name.,NA,50,"I recently stayed at the Oakwood in Ortigas for three weeks.  This is truly one of the best places that I've ever stayed.  The employees at the Oakwood are some of the greatest people I have come across while traveling, and they make you feel like you are right at home at the Oakwood.  They remember your name, greet you throughout the hotel, remember what you like to eat or drink, and sometimes offer your favorite food even when it is not on the menu.  The food at the Oakroom Restaurant is diverse - anyone can find something delicious.  My most recent stay was 3 weeks, and I did not tire of the menu options.  Also, i was in one of the smaller residences - a studio - but the space was ample.  The bathroom was beautifully finished and the bed and sofa were incredibly comfortable. "
781,March 2011,The best place/hotel I ever stayed - literally!,NA,50,"The service is so professional, they make sure that they attend to your needs. You dont actually need to ask them, they will give it ot you. The rooms are clean, neat and exceeded my expectation as well as the kitchen and the bathroom with an LCD tv inside. Location wise, its accessible although the main entrance to their parking lot in not facing Ortigas Avenue but then again, its perfect. I liked the fully furnished room, the complete and detailed amenities as well as the kitchen facitlies AND not to mention your very own sauna inside the bathroom. One bedroom has 3 LCD tvs!   What I did not like is that when my son wanted to play in the kids playroom they said its closed. When I commented why would they close it on a Sunday, they said they can open it. My son decided not to"
782,May 2010,"Plush rooms, kingsize feel",NA,50,"I have stayed in Oakwood, Manila once during my business trip.   The main attraction of this hotel is the way rooms are designed. The room is actually a mini service apartment with a living room, bed room and kitchen. The bed is plush and living room is huge with a LCD screen in both living room and bed room.  In terms of location, it is bit far off the main city but the overall feeling of staying in the hotel is worth the travel.  Strongly recommended."
783,January 2011,Best apartment type accomodation in Ortigas Center area...,NA,50,"Our family had a wonderful stay at Oakwood during the recent holiday season.  Apartments have new and modern facilities - dishwashers, laundry machines, full kitchen with appliances.  Rooms and bathrooms are large and well apointed.  Staff are  very helpful and service is great. The in house restaurant, pool and gym are all very good.    There are also a lot of restaurants and several shopping malls around.  The famous Greenhills markets which everyone loves is a short car ride away.  Every Friday midnight there is a lively street food market a stone's throw away, and if you enjoy listening to bands there is a club called Chef and Brewer around the corner , (Thursday night check out Highway 54).   It is an ideal base for those who want to be in the Ortigas Center area.  I also"
784,December 2010,Better than the old Oakwood in Makati,NA,40,"Check in was a breeze despite the new year's eve rush.  Rooms are spacious.  Floor to ceiling windows, 3(!) LCD TVs in a one-bedroom suite, very big bathroom with a stand alone tub that was big enough for me (I'm 6'+), glass enclosed shower stall doubles as a steam room, very comfortable king-sized bed.  The kitchen has a super silent dishwasher and a washer-dryer.  Definitely much better than the old Oakwood, now the Ascott, in Makati.  The only odd thing were the elevators.  While waiting at the lift lobby, I could hear the conversation of the couple inside the car even when they were still a floor up!"
785,December 2010,Fabulous room and facility,NA,50,"I stayed at Oakwood twice in November and last week. The hotel has just opened so everything is very new. The room I stayed was spacious, which worth the price! It has a separate living room/dining area/kitchen, which equipped with a washing machine as well, and the bed room.   Wow, three LCD TVs (one in living room, one in bed room, and one in front of the bathtub in the bathroom!!!). There is a mini steam room combined with the shower room as well.   The swimming pool on 6th floor is good in terms of size (about 4m wide and 15m long). The gym has quite a number of equipments, though I only use the treadmill. I didn't try the steam and sauna room, so no comment.  The buffet breakfast was reasonable, though it didn't have much choices for the hot food. There are cereal, bakery,"
786,October 2010,Comforts of home with the luxuries of a hotel,NA,40,"I recently stayed at the Oakwood Premier in Pasig from October 24 to November 6. This was my second trip in a matter of months to Manila for business. The first time I stayed at the Shangri-La Makati so the Oakwood had some pretty big shoes to fill. The Oakwood is a different style of hotel than the Shangri-La so I will try not to make too many comparisons.   Oakwood's service level was preferable to me. On first stay at the Shang, the service was good but could be a bit overbearing. There were tons of people around and you were greeted by 5-6 people just walking to the elevator. Oakwood is not nearly as big or overly staffed. The front desk and security staff is friendly and there when you needed it. Check in was quick and efficient with the staff escorting you and your bags up"
787,October 2010,"The best place to stay in Ortigas, Manila!",NA,50,"Having had a bad experience with a five star hotel in Manila during our last visit, we were extra careful on choosing our accomodation this time round. Oakwood came as a top choice as our meetings were to be held in offices located within walking distance. It being relatively new, we felt Oakwood should be a 'safe' choice.  We chose a studio executive room not knowing it was more suitable for a single traveller. The room is very clean and had a well equipped kitchenette. Furniture and furnishings are new. Bed was very comfortable and room space was actually quite sufficient for 2. The room was cosy and overall very comfortable. The only qualms we had was the lack of a bathtub. We came to know bathtub is available in 1 bedroom suite and onwards.  Security in the hotel is good"
788,July 2010,Among the best in Manila!,NA,50,"There are really only good things to say about Oakwood. The current location is only about a year old – so everything still feels fairly new. The rooms are clean, modern and spacious (beds are very comfortable), service is fantastic (lots of smiling staff who make a huge effort to please and make you feel welcome), great (warm) pool and gym, and a good restaurant (with comfortable couches). Breakfast buffet is great, too. Highly recommended! No doubt we will stay there again."
789,June 2010,Beyond my expectation,NA,40,"As a Filipino living abroad, when I go home I normally stay in or near Ortigas to be close to my parents .  This year I decided to try Oakwood Premier for the first time, and it really was like being at home away from home.    When in Manila I regularly see my friends and family in my hotel and accordingly it is a positive advantage to have a seperate sitting room and bedroom.  When the visitors are young children (nephews and nieces that is) the bedroom is a sanctuary away from the crying, screaming and shouting and the fully equipped kitchen is a must, or at least cheaper than ordering room service.   The bathroom is well equipped, the steam shower is great although frankly for me a TV in the bathroom next to the bath is a little over the top, but who knows some might like"
790,June 2010,Clean and fresh,NA,50,I have never slept in a better bed in the Philippines then at this hotel. the rooms are excellent. On the 23rd floor you don't hear any noices from the streets below. A good hotel. BUT. Breakfast was not included in my booking so we went down to have breakfast. It was a simple and ordinary sellection and no more what you find at most hotels in the Philippines. When I signed the bill I was chocked. 936 Pesos a person!!!!!???? I felt robbed and blamed myself for not checking the prices before we eat. I have stay a whole night with breakfast included at hotels in the Philippines for that money:)  My advice is to stay at this hotel but stay away from the restaurant and the bar. You find plenty of better choices outside the hotel.  Walking distance to SM Megamall and Robinson
791,June 2010,Excellent choice with impeccable service,NA,50,"When I checked in I was not amused that I had to carry my suitcases by myself up to the reception which was on the other side of the building, probably it was just bad luck that nobody felt responsible, and it was partly my mistake as the hotel has 2 entrances, a main entrance where the reception is located and another entrance which serves mainly people who work or visit the ADB which is located across the road, or as in my case where the taxi driver drops you. When I entered my room I was pleasantly surprised, living room, bed room, kitchen and big bathroom, obviously I had been up-graded to a 1-bedroom apartment. There was nothing missing, free internet LAN connection in living- and bedroom, big TV screen in both rooms plus another one above the bathtub, no idea who would"
792,March 2010,Excellent Choice,NA,50,I stayed in Oakwood Joy-Nostalg from 19-28 March 2010.  The staff were very helpful and knowledgeable.  The apartment were tastefully decorated.  It was fitted with the latest modcons. It was very clean.  It was cleaned daily and stocks were replenished regularly. The location is ideal.  What more could you ask. I would definitely come back.
793,March 2010,Very nice indeed,NA,40,"This is a great hotel! The rooms are superb, the staff are great and, for me, the location was excellent as it is within a 5 minute walk to the office.  The ""residences"" are small apartments, with a living and dining area, a fully appointed kitchen, a surprisingly spacious bedroom and a super bathroom. Very nicely decorated, 3 flat screen tv's (including one in the bathroom!), 2 DVD players, coffee machine, microwave oven, iron, kettle, pots and pans, dishes, cutlery, you name it. Plenty of power outlets too, which is something that most hotels miss out on.  The only thing that lets it down a little bit is that there is only one restaurant. But the food was very nice, if a little bit on the pricey side.  Will definitely stay there again."
794,November 2009,This is more like it,NA,40,"Great staff, rooms are clean comfortable and furnished beautifully. Plenty of BIG TV's. Even a TV in the bathroom. Great bath and showers. Nice beds. Breakfast buffet is good. Nice bar. Great location. Very secure.  If I missed something you were wondering about, I will bet is is more that suitable to your needs.  Wish it had an outdoor pool but the pool and workout area are fantastic."
